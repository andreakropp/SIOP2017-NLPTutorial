The coworker appears to be a white woman.  The coworker is running her hand through her dark brown hair.  She is wearing a black dress, an orange bracelet, and appears to be about to hand a piece of paper to the black coworker.  Behind the two women are two men.  The two men appear to be talking in front of a wall mounted TV.  One of the men is wearing a pink dress shirt, and tan slacks.  The other male is shorter, has red hair, and is wearing a blue dress shirt with darker tan slacks.  Both of the men are also wearing dark brown belts.  The four of them appear to be in a small conference, or meeting room.  All four appear to be in their 20s, or 30s.  The door to the room is completely wide open.  The hallway outside of the room appears to be painted in a dark tan kind of color.  The walls in the conference room all appear to be painted the same shade of pure bright white.  The lights in the room must be on, and are adaqueate, as it is very bright inside.","We see the back of the head of a woman as she looks on as three people paint a wall mural.  The woman has brunette hair.  She is holding in her left hand (the only hand we see) a red plastic cup that contains some blue paint, and a small minature representation on paper of what the wall mural should look like when the painting is complete.  The wall mural the three people are painting appears to be a bright, impressionistic type of represenation of the Milky Way Galaxy.  The galaxy is being painted on top of a dark blue background. The center of their Milky Way Galaxy is white, and surrounded by a ring of light purple.  This purple is surrounded by another ring of yellow paint.  There are further uneven circles of blue, light green, darker purple, pink, and dark red that expand out from the galaxy's center.  The wall the people are painting on appears to have two outlets.  The whites of the outlets are the only interruption in the dark blue that makes up the galaxy's background.  One of the three painting is a woman wearing a white baseball cap backwards.  She has a white t-shirt, black shirts, white shoes, and looks to be wearing a light blue glove in her painting hand.",10/12/2015,10/12/2015,1199,60.422135

The wall is covered in a dark blue paint, while they paint a colorful galaxy over top of it. The galaxy type shape consists of purple, blue, pink, yellow, and white in the center. There's a reference painting that the teacher is holding that they seem to be trying to copy into a larger scale wall painting. The two younger girls that are doing the painting are both wearing white t-shirts and black shorts.

There are two women and two men. We are witnessing the scene through and open doorway. There is a flat screen tv on the wall in the background. The walls of the room look white. Eveything in the background is slightly blurry as the focus is on the four people. One of the women, who is white has a black dress with an orange band around her wrist.  The other woman, who is black,  has a purple dress on. She has a blue watch. She also has and orange band. I am assuming this is probably some sort of event, maybe political in nature. The black lady has a clip board she is holding against her chest as she grasps of her fingers in her free hand. She may be counting the points she is trying to make to the lady in the black dress. The two males are farther back from the doorway and are talking to one another. Both are wearing light brown dress pants.

I can see them through a doorway.  It appears to be two women talking to each other and two men conversing with each other.  Since they have their backs to each other, this is not a group discussion but two individual pairs.  One woman appears to be on her way out the door, because she seems to be partially blocking the entranceway.  

All four participants appear to be in a professional setting.  All are in professional attire and one woman has a clipboard but has it against her chest and doesn't appear to be using it in the conversation.  The other woman has a bright orange wrist band that may possibly be a bracelet & has what appears to be a small piece of paper in the other hand.  I can't see if the men have anything in their hands, because they either have their backs to me or are blocked by the women that are in the forefront of the picture.

It appears to have at least one or more video screens high up the wall in the background but it is hard to see inside the room with the doors and participants blocking the view of the room.  One video screen is brightly colored in blue and pink colors but I can't make out any picture on the screen.  The door and walls appear to be panels rather than fixed walls, the type of panels found in office cubicles.  ","This picture has a person (possibly a man) in a side profile wearing blue shorts and a light yellow or tan Tshirt and a tan baseball type cap on backwards.  This person is recreating a mural on the back wall which has a dark blue (or black) background.  There also appears to be two outlets in tan on either side of the mural.  The floor appears to have a tan drop cloth.  The mural appears to be an abstract galaxy with colors swirling in an offset eye shaped pattern.  The center of the &quot;eye&quot; is white with mauve encircling the white &quot;eye&quot; with four whirling rays giving the sense of motion on a background of egg yolk colored yellow.  Beyond the yellow, are slim patches of concentric colors of various blues, purples & a hot pink.  These areas surround the main &quot;eye&quot; giving the painting a feel of hurricane like movement.

In the forefront of the picture, I see almost a dark black shadow of a person but in their hand (which is clearly shown) is a red plastic cup of baby blue paint that appears to have been used in the painting and a used brush with the same blue paint appears beyond the shadow.  I assume it is being held by the shadow person.  Also it appears that the visible hand, behind the red cup, is holding a picture of what is to be recreated on the wall.  There is a strange sense of duality with the two pictures in the picture.  The wall mural doesn't seem to be an exact copy of the picture but the colors & movement seem a fairly good replication.  The small &quot;original&quot; picture seems to have more of an angular slant to it but the wall mural appears to be still in process and it may be more like the original in the final product.

Almost hidden at the bottom of the picture and behind the &quot;original&quot; picture is a worker sitting on their knees with the same clothing as the standing painter, but the head, shoulders are obliterated by the held picture.  I assume this is a woman due to the wider hips, but it may be a man.

Instead of being circular, it has three to four extensions of the paint in curved lines extending onto a bright yellow color. Around the yellow are more colors such as blue, light blue, a pastel-like pink, and purple. There's also another person in a white shirt painting the picture while kneeling down. His or her head and shoulders are blocked by a piece of paper however. This piece of paper features the excat same painting the two painters are painting on the wall.

In the background, there are two male employees, who are dressed in business casual attire, facing towards a television that has been placed up on the wall.  The television is a flat screen, and appears to be showing some sort of news logo.

The employee in the black dress is running her right hand through her dark, medium length hair, and is holding a small piece of white paper in her left hand.  The HR Rep is playing with the fingers on her left hand with her right hand.  In the back, the two male employees both have their arms crossed over their bodies.  The male employee on the left is slightly turned towards the male employee on the right, while the male employee on the right is almost fully turned towards the male employee on the left.

The walls inside the break room are white, while the walls just outside the break room appear to be a slightly darker color.  The door to the breakroom opens in, and the hinges to that door appear on the left hand side, just behind the employee in the black.","Three females in the photo are focusing their attention to a mural that is being painted up on a brick wall.  One of the females is not directly painting the wall, while the other two females are actively painting.  One of the active painters is squatting down while painting a lower section of the wall, while the other painter is standing, and painting in the center circle of the mural.

The mural looks like a galaxy with several different colors being used to indicate the bands of the galaxy instead of stars.  The background is a darker blue, and the bands are painted either purple, light blue, medium blue, yellow, and pink.  The very center of the galaxy is currently white.

While the wall is a brick wall, it does appear to be inside of a building.  On the floor beneath the painters, there is a tan colored tarp to catch the paint drippings.  Both of the painters are wearing white t-shirts and black shorts.  The standing painter is also wearing a white baseball cap backwards on her head, covering her medium length blonde hair.

The female who is not painting is further from the wall, and only the back of her head, and her left hand show.  She has long brown hair, and is holding a red cup stained with light blue paint inside of it.  She is also holding an image of the galaxy painted in several colors, that they are all using as a reference for the mural on the wall.",10/12/2015,10/12/2015,1392,55.671108

The wall is not being painted in a typical way, but is being painted in an artistic fashion. The individual who is painting, appears to likely be a woman. She is caucasian. She is wearing what appears to be a white shirt and black shorts. She is wearing a blue glove on her right hand, with which she is painting. She is also wearing what appears to be a backwards white hat. Her back is turned against the camera and she is rather difficult to make out in detail. There is second individual who standing directly to the front right on the camera. All that one is able to make out of this personal is their brown hair and their hand, which is holding both a red cup and a small version of the painting being duplicated on the wall. There is also one or two individuals who are assisting in the painting but our view of them is almost totally obstructed by the small version of the painting that is being held up.

She has a concerned look on her face, and she seems to be speaking with the other employee. The employee facing away from you is wearing a black dress and running her hand through her hair and seems like she may be under stress. It would seem that the employee in the purple dress is acting in the role of a supervisor and is giving a negative evaluation of the other womans work. This seems like it is either upsetting or stressfull to the woman in the black dress who apears to be trying to be having difficulty in explaining the situation that is causing her supervisor to be upset. In the backround there are two male empoyees who seem to be speaking casually in front of a monitor towards the back of the office.","In this image three people are painting a mural on a concrete wall while being supervised by a fourth person. The three painters are wearing white shirts and black shorts. It appears that the person supervising is the original artist and is holding a photo of what the mural is expected to look like once completeted. The artist is also holding a red solo cup filled with a light blue mixture of paint which is one of the colors being used to paint the mural. The other three people in the picture are the ones who are actually painting the mural on the wall. So far they have completed a little over half of the overall painting. One of the painters is currently working on the central portion of the mural while one is working on the bottom and the third person is working on the space between the other two. The picture they are painting would appear to be an off color image of a spiral galaxy. They are using colors such as purple, yellow, blue, teal and pink with white as the central bulge.

He has brown hair, lighter than the other man's, and has his mouth open as if in speech. He wears slightly darker khakis than the other man, a possibly brown belt, and a light blue dress shirt. His arms also appear to be crossed over his chest, though most of them are hidden behind the black woman. On the far wall in the background, a flatscreen television is mounted, but is out of focus, with only blue, red, white, and possibly yellow shapes discernible on it. Above the screen, there appear to be three-dimensional white letters affixed to the wall, possibly spelling a business name, but only the bottoms of these are visible. The floor behind the people is not very visible, but appears to have gray and light orange coloration. A rectangular metal door handle is also visible protruding from the foreground door frame on the left, and concealing part of the white woman's back.","In the foreground, the back of a woman's head appears, though the right half of it is out of the frame. Her hair appears to be longer than shoulder-length, and brown in color. She faces a brick wall in the background, painted navy blue, in front of which three people are working. They are painting a colorful image of a spiral galaxy that fills most of the wall. It is nearly complete, with only a few arms on top remaining in outline. The rest of it is filled in with pastel green, sky blue, purple, lavender, pink, white and yellow fields of color. All three people appear to be wearing white T-shirts, but two are crouching near the floor and almost completely concealed by a smaller, complete, version of the galaxy image. This is printed on a sheet of paper and held in front of a white woman's hand, which also clutches a red plastic cup with yellow paint around its rim. This seems to be the hand of the woman whose head is visible. The only painter not covered by the smaller image is standing to the right of it. This person's gender is unclear, but he or she wears a white baseball cap backwards, with blond hair extending behind it a few inches down his or her back. This person faces away from us and toward the wall, wears sneakers and black shorts, and has a light blue glove on his or her right hand, which stretches toward the large painting. It seems to have a brush or other painting tool in it. Across the floor beneath everybody, there is an off-white dropcloth with spatters of paint across it. Somewhere in front of the foreground woman is a rectangle that may be propped against the wall. It is unclear what it is, but it may be another small painting. It has a field of sky blue on top, with a dark green semicircle below, which may represent a hill. Below this is a light green field, possibly representing grass, and below that is a light brown field with a line of small white shapes across it.",10/17/2015,10/17/2015,1535,94.584965

She has a serious look on her face, which borders a bit on the negative side. At the very least it is not a happy face. It's impossible to tell what they are talking about, but the photo gives the impression that it is a serious discussion. The lady in the black dress is facing away from the camera. She is looking at the other lady and touching her hair, while gesturing with her other hand. She appears nervous. It seems likely that the other lady is lecturing or chastising her about something. There are also two people standing in the back ground. They are both men wearing casual business attire and having a conversation. They both look pretty involved in it. It does not appear to be an especially negative conversation. There is a television playing on the wall behind them.","A woman is painting a mural on a wall. She is wearing a white hat and white shirt. She has on black shorts. She wears blue acrylic gloves while she paints.

The left hand is holding a red plastic cup filled with blue paint. A photo sits in front of them, and it appears identical to the mural that is being painted. We cannot tell the sex of the person watching the painter. There is also a third person kneeling down near the mural, and it seems likely they are working on it as well. We cannot be sure because they are mostly hidden from view.

The painting is an abstract type work, with blue, purple, yellow, pink, and a dark blue background. It appears to be some type of galaxy, with a white center. It is rather attractive, and sets a calming mood for the room. The mural is being painted on what looks like a cinderblock wall. The entire wall has been painted a dark blue, and the mural is being painted on top of that. It looks rather nice. ",10/7/2015,10/7/2015,1265,83.402057

One man in a pink shirt and khaki pants appears slightly joyful, while the other man in a blue shirt and khaki pants appears more serious. A woman in a black dress stands behind them, holding the door to the room open with her back. She has a silver watch on one wrist and a thick orange wristband on the arm she is using to reach up to her brown hair. Her back is to the camera and she is reaching forward with one of her hands toward the men. Between her fingers is a folded piece of white paper. In front of the other three people, a woman in a bright purple dress is walking out of the room. She wears a blue wristwatch, a brightly colored wristband, and two silver rings on different hands.

In her left outstretched hand, she is gripping a tall red plastic cup that contains paint. The inside of the cup is stained with light blue paint and the outside with light blue and yellow paint. In front of the cup, she is gripping a rectangular image of the mural that has probably been used as a guide by the painters. It is printed on white paper which frames the image of the mural. The image of the mural partially obscures the two painters that are kneeling on the floor. Only their backs, their white t-shirts, and the dark shorts of one of the painters are visible. Standing to the right of the kneeling painters is the third painter. She is also wearing a white t-shirt and dark shorts, as well as white sneakers and a white colored baseball cap. She is wearing the cap backwards over her long blond hair. She is painting a purple portion of the mural, near the center. Her hand holding the paintbrush has a blue glove on it and her other hand holds another red cup presuambly containing paint. The floor is covered by a large canvas tarp, covered in various shades of spilled paint. There is a small painting on the floor, leaning against the wall to the right of the standing painter.

The tone of the picture is friendly. There are four people sharing information informally. The workspace is diverse. What I noticed right away is that there are two men and two women. They are all dressed in business attire. I would say the environment, though professional, allows for freedom of expression. Although each person is dressed professionally, there is variety. One of the women is wearing a purple dress. Purple is a color that may not be accepted in some strict office environments, so that is what leads me to this conclusion. There are three Caucasian individuals and one black person. The black person also happens to be a woman. That means there is a culture of diversity in the office. I see that there are large monitors in the office space. This office seems to be technologically advanced also. They are in tune with technology and are not afraid to implement it. ","This picture is interesting. There are several artists who appear to be re-creating a painting into a mural. The background is dark, maybe dark blue. The art is very abstract and colorful. It resembles very much the look of a hurricane that you would see on Doppler radar. There seems to be another artist who is overseeing the project. She is standing back and looking at the mural as it progresses. She is also holding a photo of the original artwork. Maybe she is assessing the two artists for accuracy. So far, I think that the artists are doing a good job of re-creating the artwork. The artists appear to be young. From what I see they are female. The canvas is a block wall. I find it interesting that they are using drinking cups to hold the paint they are using. The mural I not complete. It is probably about sixty-five percent complete.

In the same hand that she is holding this picture, she is also holding a cup of paint that looks to be heavily used. The cosmos that are being painted has a dark blue background. The swirls that look like a graphic of a hurricane, contain the colors of blue, yellow, purple, and a dark pink. The artist looks to be done with most of the work so far, basing it off of the source, but there are still lots of many little details that are still missing from the mural. There is a tarp on the ground to catch excess paint and the painter herself is wearing one glove.

She appears to be trying to hand it to the second young woman, who is ignoring it.  She also has an orange band around her wrist.  The second young woman is wearing a purple dress and holding a clipboard tightly to her chest with her left arm.  Two of her fingers are outstretched and she is touching them with her right hand, almost giving the impression that she is counting.  She has a blue and white watch on her wrist.

One shirt looks a bit pink, while the other looks bluish.  The men are speaking to each other and you can see each of their faces in profile.

In her left hand she holds the miniature of the mural and a red cup with light blue paint inside.  Because of the positioning of the miniature picture she's holding, two of the artists are nearly entirely obscured.  It is difficult to be certain if those obscured artists are male or female.

Standing to the right of the mural with the other artists is a young woman.  She, too, is wearing a white shirt and black shorts.

It almost looks like a galaxy.  In the center is a white, not-quite-round circle.  Pastel pink surrounds it with bright yellow almost completely surrounding the pink area.

On top of that is painted the swirling pinwheel design, consisting of swaths of lilac/light-purple, then ligh/baby-blue, then yellow, with smaller streaks of pink. The abstract style of painting and the colors add to the feeling of tropic waters in an area that is propably very water-centric - and prone to hurricanes. Maybe the scene of this art is in Florida.

The woman in the purple dress seams to be some sort of leader, she carries a clipboard, and is listening to the woman in the black dress.

There are three people in the scene, one person in the mid right of the frame, painting the mueril. One in the middle who's top half is blocked by the painting, painting a lower part of the mueril.

An African-American with shoulder length hair, she wears a nice fuchsia dress and holds a clipboard tight to her chest. Both her arms have different objects upon them. On her right is a white and orange wristband, while a blue watch is on her left. Looking off into the distance, the woman looks worried and stressed. Turned in the other direction are her three co-workers. One of them is another female. Wearing a simple black ensemble, this woman runs her right hand through her hair. As she does so, her orange wristband inches closer towards the doorframe in which she stands. In her left hand, she has a small piece of paper. She looks at what is in front of her (and what is behind the other woman) ? two male co-workers. Like the woman in black, they too are Caucasian. Neither is particularly attractive; they look like your average office worker in Middle America. Both are decked out in work khakis with ever-so-slightly wrinkled button-down shirts tucked into cheap belts. Almost as a comment on the gender divide at this particular company, the men wear opposing colors ? blue and pink. They are discussing something work-related with their arms crossed. Though neither man is watching it, a flat screen television is on in the back of the room. ","There is a room with navy blue walls. Though the color is striking enough and much better than the boring shades of white that plague numerous buildings and homes, it is apparently not enough. This is made clear by multiple people working tirelessly to paint something onto its surface. Two individuals are on the floor, which is covered with a tarp. Both on their knees, it almost seems as if they are praying to the Gods for help with their artistic endeavors. They are both blocked by something that one can only assume is a rendering of the art they are creating. Above these two is a woman. She has a blonde ponytail and is wearing the same thing the other two are - painting clothes. That is, an outfit that she wouldnt mind getting a little bit dirty. She has a hat on backwards and is staring intently at the wall, at her very own canvas. Another woman stands in the foreground, with only her auburn hair visible. She holds a red plastic cup in her hand. This is not for drinking though, but rather is being used to hold some paint. She is looking at the work of art in progress. What is being drawn is not entirely clear. It most closely resembles a galaxy. Perhaps it is even a mural of weather patterns. It might just be a random vision of one of the many artists in this room. All that is clear is that this is beautiful. It has splotches of purple, swirls of the brightest blues, and circles of canary yellow. In the very center is a small section of white. It could be unfinished work, representing the fact that art is never truly done. Maybe it is the eye of this particular storm. Either way, this focal point pulls the entire painting together, bringing some sense of order to the artistic chaos.",10/11/2015,10/11/2015,1413,47.889028

The doors are inside doors which are inside of another building- not doors that lead to the outside, so it seems that they are in some kind of office building. The doors  appear to open into their office space. The area inside the two doors appears to be large and perhaps contains offices and other work areas inside of it.

Her hair is brown and she has one hand up running her fingers through it. She is also wearing an orange wristband. In her other hand is some small object, possibly some kind of card. She is holding it out in between her index and middle finger. It seems she is in the middle of talking, but it's hard to tell without seeing her face. The one facing forward is young, black and in a purple dress. Her hair is either black or dark brown. She's wearing a watch and holding a clipboard. She is also wearing an orange wristband.

The photograph is taken over the shoulder of a white woman with brown hair. We can only see the left side of her head and her left shoulder going about 15% into the image from the right side, as well as her hand in the middle. She is holding a red plastic cup, ie what looks like the typical dixie cups found everywhere in America. It's possible it's actually ceramic or glass, but it looks plastic. It's difficult to tell what's inside, but it seems to be water. That could just be the rim of the inside though. The cup also has some splotches of yellow/blue near the rim on the outside. She is also holding a paper with an image on it. It looks to be something printed off a computer. It depicts what I'd guess is a galaxy, though could be anything with a swirling galaxy like structure. The middle of the image has a white lump I imagine to be the luminous collection of stars found in the middle of a galaxy. From it come swirls of many colors, eg purple, deep blue, light blue, pink, yellow, magenta, and possibly some others. It's set against a black backdrop. In front of the woman and the things in her hand, we can see a cinderblock wall painted blue. There are three people visible. Two are crouching and are blocked by the image in the woman's hand so it's difficult to tell anything about them other than their dark pants and white shirts.

The image being painted is the same as the one on the paper in the woman's hand. They seem to be about 80% through painting it.

The two men are engaged in discussion.

The two women, one white and one black, are likewise engaged in discussion. The white woman is wearing a black dress and has an orange bracelet of some type. The white woman is gesturing towards her conversation partner with one hand, and has the other hand behind her head. The black woman, wearing a purple dress, is holding a clipboard and wears a watch with a blue band. The black woman also has a multi-colored bracelet of some sort on her other wrist.

Both men and the white woman have their backs turned away, while the black woman is partially facing our perspective.

The room they're in is white with only one noticeable feature. There is a display screen hanging from the ceiling in the background. The entire scene is viewed from what appears to be another room, through an open doorway. There's a latch of some sort on the left side of the doorway framing this scene.","The scene shows a mural artist painting what appears to be a stylized representation of a galaxy on a wall. The wall is painted in a dark blue for background, and the galaxy itself is a spiraling vortex of purples, blues, oranges, and yellows, with a white core at its center. The mural artist appears to be a woman, and is wearing a baseball cap backwards with a white shirt and black shorts.

In the foreground there is what appears to be a woman holding a paper printout of the desired galaxy painting, guilding the process. Only her left hand and part of the left side of her head is visible, viewed from behind her. Her left hand is holding both the paper printout and a red plastic cup that appears to have blue paint in it.

Two other women appear to be engaged in painting the mural as well. Both are wearing white shirts and what look to be black shorts similar to the prominently visible artist. Not much more detail can be made out because they're both obscured by the paper printout in the foreground.

It's possible that she is going over a checklist with her as she appears to be counting two items with her fingers. The woman with the clipboard seems to be making direct eye contact with the woman that she is questioning or talking to. The woman in the black dress with the orange bracelet seems to be acting uneasy and a bit restless. Her hand is touching her hair as if she is fidgeting because she is hearing some information that might be unsettling or embarrassing to her. She is gesturing with her other hand in an open palmed and defensive manner. There are two men conversing in the background. They are wearing the normal business attire of dress shirts and pants.

She is painting the stylized universe that is on the piece of paper onto the dark blue wall in the background. There is a tarp laying on the ground, presumably so the artist doesn't get any paint on the floor. It appears that there are two more people who are crouched down on the floor painting as well. It is hard to see them as they are obscured by the reference picture that the woman in the foreground is holding. The painting seems to contain various shades of paint including yellow, white, purple, pink and several shades of blue.

Both separate conversations appear to be taking place in the breakroom of their palce of work. The televisions in the back do not have any image that would depict if this was a work room or a breakroom. The woman in purple most likely picked this place to confront her employee so as not to intimidate her. It is a neutral environment where she can feel as though she is not in any kind of major trouble. If that were the case then the meeting would have taken place in a private office behind closed doors where no one else was present. ","There are four people present in the picture. Two of them appear to be women. One of them has black shorts, white shirt and a tan baseball cap. She is the painter of the two visible women. The second one is too close to the camera and has her back faced to it. She has a short hair cut and is holding a cup of baby blue or pastel blue paint and a small picture of what is being painted onto the wall.  She gives the impression that she is an assistant. She could also be the person who requested the artwork to be done and that is why she is standing in the back observing. This woman has a framed picture with multiple colors in a swirl pattern against a black background. There are also two more painters hidden by the picture that is being held by the no painting woman. These other two also have black shorts and white shirts like the other woman who is visible painting.  They are copying this picture onto a large brick wall that has been painted black like the background of the framed picture. They has the picture stenciled out and are in the process of coloring it in. They appears to be halfway done with the painting. ",10/12/2015,10/12/2015,1865,54.52464

Two men appear in the background apparently talking about some new technology.  They are dressed business casual (khakis and button down shirts) and appear to be discussing something that appears on a monitor behind them.  Two women appear in the foreground by the door to the conference room.  They are also wearing appropriate business attire.  The woman facing out the door is holding a clipboard and appears to be the leader of the meeting.  She is gauging the other woman's interest in the topic.  The meeting leader appears to be counting on her fingers - perhaps getting some ideas from the other woman.  The other woman appears to be somewhat agitated.  She is playing with her hair and has somewhat of a defensive posture.  It is hard to judge exactly what this meeting was about as the two discussions that appear to be taking place have a very different vibe.  The two men in the background appear to be friendly and jovial while the two women in the foreground appear to be involved in a more tense exchange.,"In this picture, some artists are painting a mural of what appears to be a radar image of a hurricane.  This image is likely a depiction of the wind or moisture associated with the storm as there are many different vibrant colors.  The eye of the storm is white while the area right around the storm is a gray shade.  Outside of that are yellows and blues.  This is on a background of a dark blue so my guess is that this image was taken while the storm was out to sea.  Of course it is a little difficult for me to decipher all of the colors because I color blind but I can tell that there are many different colors and they are vibrant.  One of the artists is standing.  She is wearing shorts and a t-shirt with a backwards baseball cap.  There are two other artists kneeling by the bottom of the mural.  They are partially obscured because there is a person in the foreground holding a picture of the storm.  This appears to be a woman who is likely an art teacher.  She is also holding a red cup in her left hand.  This could be a beverage but could also be a cup of water to wash brushes.",10/1/2015,10/1/2015,1226,92.414563

She is facing the camera but is looking slightly to her right where she appears to be engaged in a conversation with another female.  The second female is visible from the side and is standing close to the leftmost part of the doorway.  The second female is dressed in black, and her face is not visible in the photo. She is touching the back of her head with her right hand on which she is wearing an orange wristband of some sort.   The second female appears to be holding a note in her left hand, which she may be attempting to pass to the female in the purple dress.  In the background of the photo are two Caucasian males who seem to be involved in a separate conversation.  The male on the left is somewhat tall and is wearing a light (possibly pink) shirt and khaki pants.  He is situated in the background and is visible between the two females who are in the foreground.  He is closer to the female on the left.  The tall male has his back to the camera but is facing to his right and looking at another male who is partially obscured by the right side of the door frame.  The second male is wearing a blue shirt and khaki pants and is shorter than the first male.  The males are facing each other, and the shorter male appears to be speaking while the taller male listens.  In the very back of the photo on the inside of the room is a television or computer screen which is powered on and appears to be mounted on the gray wall.  The screen is illuminated in various shades of blue, and whatever is on the screen is out of focus.  You can see a little bit of orange in the middle of the screen, but it is not clear what is on the screen.","This photo depicts three artists painting a swirling design onto a blue block wall.  The entire wall surface is captured in the photo in a straight ahead shot.  The most visible artist is standing near the center of the wall and to the right of two seated artists.  The standing artist is a blonde female wearing a white baseball cap which she wears backwards.  She is dressed in a white shirt and black shorts. Her face is obscured because she is facing away from the camera and toward the block wall. She is painting a purple swirl near the center of the design.  There is a large approximately 2' x 3' print of this same swirling design to the left of and slightly behind the blonde female.  It is unclear how the print is actually affixed to the scenery in the photograph, and it may actually be photoshopped in.  The swirling design that appears on both the print and on the block wall looks a bit like a spiral galaxy, but with solid colors that change concentrically as you progress inward in the design.  The colors that appear on the design from outside to inside are dark purple, light blue, pink, yellow, light purple and white.  The white center portion roughly circular and, on the wall, is about the size of a volleyball.  The print of the design is situated behind two seated artists to the left of the blonde artist.  These two seated artists are mostly obscured by the print.  The only identifying features visible on the seated artists are the lower backs of their white shirts,  At least one of them is wearing black shorts.  I presume they are females but that is speculation.  In the foreground of the photo on the extreme right, there is half of the back of a brunette woman's head.  She appears to be watching the painting activities.  She is holding in her left hand a red disposable plastic cup that appears to be full of the same light blue paint being used on the wall.  The cup is directly in front of the print that I suspect was photoshopped into the picture, however, it is slightly possible that the brunette woman is holding the print in front of the cup, athough it seems unlikely based on the position of her fingers.

The other woman is in a black dress and is fussing either fussing with her hair or gesturing. I can't really be sure. Another pair of men are speaking to one another just behind them. There is a television mounted to the wall in the background. It appears to be playing some sort of news broadcast. The walls of the hallway are painted in a greyish-brown sort of color, while the rest of the room and the door frame are painted in a soft white. The camera seems to be in a tight focus on the people, and most details of the room itself are blurred away. It is also difficult to figure out exactly what's being discussed, or even the purpose of the meeting itself. The picture seems to be a generic stock image.","A group of three women are engaged in the process of painting a mural on a wall. The mural is of a spiralling galaxy, done in flat solid patches of color. The paints seem to be of a pastel-oriented pallete, with a navy blue background. One woman , who is standing in the foreground with her back to the camera is holding a sketch of what the final product of the mural will look like. Also in her hand is a plastic Solo cup which is being used to hold paint. There are two women actually engaged in painting the mural at the time of the shot. One, a blonde wearing a white hat, white shirt, and black shorts is working on filling a white field in the center of the galaxy. The other, while being partially obscured by the sketch in the hand of the woman in the foreground, seems to be dressed in a similar fashion with a white shirt and black shorts.

All four people are standing and there is a tv on in the background. The woman holding the clipboard is wearing a purple dress, and she has a watch and two rings on. The other woman is wearing a black dress and seems to have some sort of a wrist band on her hand. She is holding a paper in one hand and is running her other hand through her hair.

There is one painter who is standing up and you can see her clearly. The other two painters are kneeling and are partly covered up by the photo that is being held up in the forefront of the photo. From what I can see, it looks like all three painters are also wearing black shorts and tennis shoes. The painting reminds me of the shape of the Milky Way. It looks as though they drew an outline of the painting first and are now working on filling it in with paint. The wall that they are painting on is a dark blue.

The male on our left has his back to us but we can tell he is white because his face is turned to his right and is visible.   He appears overweight.    The person he is talking to is also only partially visible but we can see a portion of his face so we know his ethnicity.  All four people appear to be dressed in clothing appropriate for a work environment.  The African American woman is wearing a purple outfit; the other woman is dressed in black.  The African American woman is holding a clipboard.  The men are both wearing dress shirts; the overweight man is wearing a light shirt which is white but may have a pinkish tint to it.  The other man's shirt is light blue.   Behind all four people we see what looks like some type of monitor which is either on a desk or attached to a wall. On the monitor we see a word in red or orange lettering, but it can't be determined what the word is.  The background  on the monitor consists of various shapes in dark blue, light blue, and white.  The four people are standing close to one another; the men not far behind the women.   The man on the left shows no emotion, the man on the right looks concerned.  The African American shows no emotion and we can't see the face of the other woman.  ","A person is painting a picture on a large canvass which covers a wall.  The person appears to be a woman but this is not certain because her face is not visible.

She is wearing a light cap; she has on a shirt which is either white or a very light yellow.  She is wearing dark shorts, and they are quite short.

She has dark or red hair and isholding a red plastic cup in one hand.  In front of her is a monitor of average size.  What we see on the monitor is extremely similar to the picture that the other woman is painting, but it is not exactly the same.

We can see yellow, white, light purple,dark purple, light blue, dark blue, and what looks to be either orange or very dark red.  some of the shapes are circular, and some are lines that are slanted at various angles.  the middle of the painting consists of a rather small white circle surrounded by a purple-ish figure which if you look closely at, seems to have what could pass as two arms; one on either side, and a small line on the top of it.

There appears to be at least two computer monitors in the room perhaps related to the upcoming meeting, but the content on the screen is not readable.  Both of the females are wearing orange wristbands that one would find at a pay-to-enter type of event.  The wrists of the males are not visible.  Overall, my analysis of this photo is that people are attending some type of business seminar with limited attendance and they are either on a break or the meeting has not yet begun.","This photo is of a group of people painting a mural on a wall.  Three people who appear to be females are all dressed in white T-shirts and dark blue athletic shorts are in progress painting on a wall recreating the image from a small photo that is being held by a fourth person.  The wall is a large cinderblock wall in what appears to be a hallway.  Given the attire of the group and the hallway that is similar to one found in many high school and college buildings, one could infer this is in an educational setting and the painters are students.  The fourth person appears to be monitoring the progress of the painting as an advisor would be overseeing a project.  The subject matter of the image being painted can be described as very similar to standard images depicting a galaxy in space.  The colors: white, purple, yellow, blue, pink are unusual for this type of subject, but the stereotypical elliptical overall shape with colors in a somewhat circular pattern is unmistakable.

There are four individuals visible in the image; however, the visibility of the faces of each individual varies. Only one face, of a woman, is faced toward the camera. There are two caucasian men, one whose face is sideways to the camera, but whose body, approximately to the knee, is mostly visible; the other who is blocked from clear view of the lens by a doorframe, but whose side profile is also partially visible. The fourth individual is what appears to be another woman whose back is facing the camera. More specifically, there is a light-skinned African American woman in a deep purple sleeveless dress, carrying a clipboard, who appears to be talking to another woman in a black dress to her right, the aforementioned individual whose back is facing the camera, with medium length brown hair that she is stroking with her right arm on which an orange bracelet is visible. In the same line of sight, standing in front of the woman with the black dress, is one of the formerly mentioned men who is wearing a light pink shirt and khakis with a brown belt, who has his arms crossed across his chest while speaking to the other man partially obscured by the doorframe. The latter man is wearing a traditional blue oxford shirt and slightly darker, belted khakis. Both men are facing each other and appear to be having a discussion. All of this is taking place in a rather bland white office environment in which a single television monitor, currently in the on position with an indecipherable image on the screen, is visible along the farthest wall. The vantage point of the photographer appears to be in an adjoining room or hall, as the doorway into the previously described room, in which the individuals are standing, is flanking both the right and left sides of the frame.  ","The overview of this image appears to be capturing a working artist who is currently in the process of painting on a generously oversized canvas that a conservative estimate might place at approximately 8 feet high by 10 feet long. A woman or man, whose brown hair and head are partially visible in the right hand corner of the frame, appears to be watching the artist while holding a red solo cup of turquoise blue paint in an outstretched hand. The aforementioned canvas is leaning up against what one assumes is a wall, though it is difficult to say with definitive certainty as there are no identifiable objects in the room visible whereby one might delineate precisely what kind of environment the image is taken in -- or even, in fact, if it is a room at all. The artist -- whose back is to the camera and is not clearly identifiable as male or female -- is standing in front of the canvas, leaning slightly with an arm outstretched toward the canvas, and their hand, arguably not quite touching the canvas, is covered in paint that looks precisely the same shade of turquoise mentioned in the cup being held by the woman. The artist is caucasian with blonde hair partially cascading out from under a cream-colored baseball cap worn backwards; they are dressed in a white short-sleeved t-shirt and navy or black shorts with side vents. The painting on the canvas itself is an abstract piece of work. It thus far appears to be a deep navy background with circular shaped swirls -- in varying sizes and colors -- populating the center of the image, covering approximately 6 feet in height and 8.5 feet in length. The swirls alternate in color but are primarily, from outermost to innermost points respectively, medium purple, cornflower blue intermixed with smaller strips of seafoam green and salmon, surrounding a larger yellow circle with a center that is a lightly browner purple circling a cream color. In front of the canvas rests an empty white frame on the ground which appears to be covered entirely in a painter's dropcloth. ",9/19/2015,9/19/2015,2099,36.660815

A woman in a dark shirt is standing back, holding the picture they are basing the wall design on, which shows that the painting is around 80% finished. She is holding a cup that has light blue paint, which looks like her part of the painting is finished on the wall. Two other people are kneeling down in front of the wall and working on the bottom part of the picture, but they are somewhat hidden by the picture the woman in the dark blue shirt is holding up. The fourth person is standing to the right of the two people on the floor and is painting the center part of the image.

The break rooms may contain tables for eating and TVs to watch during the off time. Many employees, however, wind up using these break rooms to discuss aspects of their jobs and work related activities, which makes it difficult for the employee to separate themselves from work.

In the picture above, we have employees congregating in a room with a television on in the background, but it seems the employees are more involved with discussion amongst themselves than taking time off. In fact, one woman (in the purple dress) carries a clipboard and is likely discusssing HR related topics with an employee. The two men behind them are discussing something entirely different, although they appear to be equals in similar roles.

The break room, assuming that's what the room we are looking at is,-- as we only have a view from the doorway and have a limited scope in our vision-- is being used for work activities and is counter-productive. Employees of companies are all too often afraid of taking actual time away from the job and place too great of an importance ont he job itself. Breaks from work and occasional time, in the long run, allow for greater productivity.","The picture above uses some fun perspective to show the image before the image. The viewer of the main picture above takes the perspective immediately above  a woman's left shoulder and we can partially see part of her head as well as a cup of paint in her left hand that is extended in front of us/her. Beyond that cup is an abstract, colorful image of what seems to be a galaxy in space with a white border around the image. The galaxy itself is an image of bright yellows, blues, purples and pinks on a black background.

Beyond the first image of the galaxy we find a brick wall with 3 women painting the exact same image upon it. There is a painter's dropcloth on the ground and 2 women on their knees painting the bottom of it with a third woman to the right painting the center of the galaxy image. The image is much larger, naturally, and the colors become much more vibrant when present on the larger canvas. The outside of the brick wall is painted in black and contains some electrical outlets as well. The woman painting that is visible is wearing a backwards hat and blue rubber gloves. The other two women, who are on their knees painting the bottom fo the image, are mostly out of view behind the smaller of the galaxy pictures.

To the right of the brick wall it seems it ends and the room goes further, but the first woman, who's perspective we have taken, has her head blocking the rest of the view.",9/30/2015,9/30/2015,1099,76.550578

Adorned with blues, and purples along the outside, the image perceives that of a cloud vortex, spinning all the while with lightning or magic about, creating a vibrant spectacle of light and purpose.  Yellow on the inside also means it could be a portal, opening to who knows where.  The woman in the foreground, the brunette with the image, is also holding a cup, which looks like a rinse aid for the paints being used in the project.  She might even be there for insight to help things along with the other two artists.  Perhaps when they come back to rinse off the colors they ask her how the image looks, or what details need to be touched up.  Looks like all they have to fill in is a little bit in the middle and a little bit up top.  The job done on the image is exquisite.",10/11/2015,10/11/2015,1114,59.334006

The entire scene seems to be in a casual setting as a television can be viewed in the background currently displaying the news. ",The picture instantly directs your eye to the semi-comleted hand painting in the background and then draws the eye out to the photograph being held in which is being copied to the cinderblock wall. The woman holding the guide image is also holding a red cup containing light blue paint which is applied to the wall. Two other females are working intently on painting the image while following the outline that has been sketched on the wall prior to painting. While the painting is not identifyable it can be hypothesied as some sort of bacteria under a microscope or the contrary a completely made up image of random shapes and colors. ,10/17/2015,10/17/2015,1417,83.714985

She gives them a picture of Victors favorite picture of outer space and ask if they could recreate it on the wall that would be behind his bed. They say yes, of course and as they paint, Amy holds up the picture and compares it to the mural. It looks great! When Victor arrives back home he is ecstatic to see his room.

The woman with the clipboard is in charge of the meeting.  She is talking with the woman in the black dress to make sure that the preparations are ready for the meeting.   In parallel, behind the two women talking, two other men who are also meeting participants are also discussing a work issue before the meeting starts.   The two men are using this time to address this issue before the main meeting commences.   The meeting participants are all within a conference room within their building.  There is also a flat screen monitor on the wall in front of them that might be used to present the slides that will be part of today's meeting.   The meeting participants are keeping the door of the conference room open as they are expecting more participants to arrive before the meeting starts.   The meeting participants are all wearing business casual (i.e., shirts, slacks, dresses, etc) so this is an environment that doesn't require formal business dress.   The conference room also seems to be very well lighted and very bright inside.   Finally, none of the participants are displaying a smartphone anywhere so they all seem to be focused on the conversations that they are having with their peers.","In this picture, several artists are painting a bright mural on a wall.  The wall looks to be a brick-like wall with large stone bricks that make up a consistent pattern.  The base of the wall is painted dark blue.  The mural has multiple colors, including yellow, light blue, pink, white, and purple.  The mural looks like a swirl of each of these colors - and looks similar to the patterns that are shown when a hurricane or a typhoon is shown on a weather report.   There appear to be a total of four (4) artists.  Three artists are painting the mural and another artist is holding the picture that is being used for the design as well as a cup of paint.    One artist is on the right side of the mural and is painting at the core of the swirl. The other two artists are on their knees and are painting at the bottom of the mural but some of their actions are obscured by the fourth artist who is holding the picture in front of them.   There is also a part of the mural that appears to be unpainted and looks to be near the top of the mural.   It appears that artists will eventually start to fill in the outlined portions that haven't been painted yet based on the original picture that the fourth artist is holding.   On this wall, there also appear to be electrical outlets near the bottom toward both the left and the right side of the mural.   ",10/17/2015,10/17/2015,1278,81.341257

It looks like the woman in purple is an office manager or human resources manager is asking the woman in black, an employee, to complete several tasks.  She is counting on her fingers what she needs, and the steps that need to be taken to get it done.  The employee is running her fingers through her hair and seems to be a little flustered at the amount of work she needs to get done.  In the background, two men in khakis and button-down shirts (business casual dress) are discussing a project they are working on together.  They look to be trying to collaborate on something.

The appearance of the environment seems to suggest that they are loacted within a professional building, perhaps used for scientific, medical, or business-related work or research. They are all standing near a doorway and are positioned in a way that seems more casual, perhaps before a meeting, as one woman is holding a clipboard. Judging by the neutral expressions on the three visible faces, the conversations occuring are likely related to some technical aspect of their business. The outfits worn by these individuals also support the theory that they are in a professional environment. The focal point of the image is the woman to the right of the photo. She is more in focus than the two men behind her, and unlike the woman to her left, she is not gesturing in a way that causes her to be less clearly defined. She also stands out because her fuschia dress is one of only sources of color amongst the muted shades of off-white and beige and the darker browns and blacks . The blue and red hues of the monitor in the background are somewhat obscured and out of focus, so they do not attract the eye quite as much. ","This colorful image depicts three people working on a mural, though two are mostly obscured behind a picture held by a fourth individual. Whether the picture is actually being held is somewhat unclear because the hand pictured is clearly grasping a red cup, but the person could also be holding the image with their fingers. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense within the image, as it would just be floating in air. In this photo, we are looking over the shoulder of this fourth person, which provides the perspective of an outsider but also gives a similar idea of what he or she would be seeing. The photo or illustration held by this person is very similar to the image being painted on the wall in front of them. However, the mural is still a work in progress, and the photo is likely their reference and how they want the final result to look. The painting appears to be an abstracted representation of the Milky Way or something of a similar shape. The center of the mural is a bold yellow that draws the eye, with  pastel shades of pink, purple, and blue surrounding it on a dark blue background. The individual closest to the camera is holding a cup with paint on the edges and may be involved in the painting, as well, but only their hair and hand are visible.

The woman in the purple dress with the clip board appears to be the supervisor and she does not look entirely happy. The woman in the black dress appears to be uncomfortable and possibly defending herself or her actions she had most recently taken. Possibly trying to give an explanation as to her decision making process. Her touching her hair is where I believe she seems either nervous or just uncomfortable with her supervisor. She is holding her hand out in a direction as if she is listing out reasons for her actions. The supervisor looks skeptical and not entirely understanding as to what the reasonings were and she appears to be trying to rationalize before making a decision as to what steps to take next. This is not a private setting with the two men standing in the back which would also make the woman in black uncomfortable if she is concerned they will over hear. The woman in black is also backed against a door way which I believe is a sign of intimidation. The woman in purple seems to not be closed off at all and is shoulder strong proving that she is not intimidated but is the intimidator. There is a paper in the woman in blacks hands which makes me believe she was on her way somewhere and was stopped by this supervisor to have this conversation so she was not entirely prepared. ,This appears to be a wall of an indoor building that is possibly abandoned or is an attempt at restoration. There is even a chance it was possibly an old art museum in some major city somewhere and this is one of the exhibit pieces they are attempting to re-create. The woman holding the picture up is probably the woman in charge of this project and is assessing the likeness between the one in the photo to the one on the wall. She is also holdng paint in her hands which would suggest she is probably one of the painters as well if not the leader of the painting. The two woman in white are her helpers that are there supporting her in this project. The building appears to be pretty old based on its cement makeup and this painting looks to be an interpretation of a solar system. There is an obvious ouline of the area's that have yet to be completed towards the top where they are going to fill in the remaining colors. It must be a fairly warm day as they are in t-shirts and shorts. There appears to be four people in total of this group three that are currently painting and the 1 asessing. However the one asessing almost appears to be wearing black and not white. The drop matt that is on the floor has a lot of paint on it in places where the colors don't match with the current colors being used on the left side which would lead me to believe this is not their first project and that painting is something they do quite often together. ,9/30/2015,9/30/2015,1512,32.7173

In having this  common bond, they are willing to donate their time and their skills to pay it forward as a way of expressing their gratitude and hope.

The photographer is located outside the room and we can see on the lateral edges the frame of the door with the door open on the left hand side. There are four people present; two women at the forefront and two men behind. All of them are young (between 20 and 35 years old). In the background it is possible to see a white wall with a large digital screen with an abstract picture in various blues and red/pink. The two women chat with each other. The men talk to each other and there is no interaction between the men and the women. The woman on the left wears a black dress with short sleeves and an orange bracelt on her right wrist. She seems to have a bandage around her left index. We cannot see her face; only her back faces the viewer. She has fair skin and long dark hair. The woman she talks to is on the right. She wear a purple dress and holds a clipboard in her left hand. Her wristwatch is visible in front of the clipboard and on her right wrist she wears a bracelet (white and orange). She has a dark skin and dark long hair. 
The men behind wear beige kakhi pants. Both men are taller than the two women at the forefront. The man on the left has a white shirt. We can see his back mainly but also his face profile. He has short dark hair and a fair skin. The man on the right is slightly shorter and we can see him only partially. He wears a blue shirt. He has a fair skin and light brown hair. The whole atmosphere seems somewhat serious but relax. ","This is a landscape format photograph representing the creation of an artistic mural executed by three young artists with someone with the original drawing holding a cup of blue paint in front of them. The photographer was positionned in front of the wall--almost parallel to it. The mural is painted on a wall composed of concrete blocks. The theme of the mural is a nebulae with a strong girating clockwise movement. The color of the background is dark blue and the nebulae is white at the center with a circle of light purple surrounding it framed by a large golden yellow concentric circle and the final graphic shapes that indicate the movement are in various blues and purples with a few streaks of pink. We can see one of the three artists painting; she is located on the center right of the picture. She wears a cap, a white t-shirt, balck shorts, and sneakers. She has fair skin and  blond hair. Her two co-workers are crouched and wear white t-shirts (one has also black shorts). However they are almost invisible because they are behind the original drawing of the project that is held by the fourth person present on the picture. 
This last person is close to the photographer and we can see only her left hand holding a red plastic cup with blue paint in it and the small scale original drawing of the mural thatn is enlarged on the wall. On the right of the picture we can see some long hair.The skinof the hand is fair and the hair is light brown. The picture captures an instant in the production of a large mural. It is a working atmosphere. It is not clear if the fouth person is a supervisor or not. The three artists seem young.",10/15/2015,10/16/2015,55221,39.135725

She is holding a few of her fingers with the other hand like she is either counting something or is anxious. The woman has rings on her finger and a nice watch suggesting she is a professional. Behind her is a tall white man in dress clothes talkng to another white man in dres clothes. On the back wall behind all of them is a TV.

You can see that one of these hidden indivduals is wearing black shorts, the other individual is wearing sneakers.

The mural and the small scale painting show a dark blue background with swirls of color. The swirls look kind of like the Milky Way Galaxy. There are numerous colors in the paining, the dominate colors are blue and purple, which are mostly on the outside of the swirl. There are some slivers of pink colors along the outside.

She is facing the opposite direction of the rest of the people and is the most in focus person in the image. She is wearing a dark pink dress and has shoulder length black hair.  She looks as though she is uncomfortable or concentrating on something either happening around or in front of her that is not apparent in the image.  She is fiddling with her fingers.

Everyone is wearing office attire and conversing like typical co-workers. In the very back there's a high-definition television that might be tuned into the news channel. In the immediate foreground, however, there's an African American holding a clipboard conversing with what appears to be a narcissistic white coworker female fixing her hair. They both appear to be bored in this apparently forced interaction between two co-workers in this obviously staged photograph. Most peculiar about this image, perhaps, is the caucasian male in the center wearing a pink t-shirt and khaki pants. He appears to be enjoying the conversation with his slightly off-screen coworker. What's peculiar about this, however, is that they've obviously been compensated enough to fake enjoying what I'm sure is a highly forced interaction between what would otherwise be two very unlikely associates. Other things of note in this photograph is that the African American lady is wearing a watch that absolutely does not go with her outfit, a ring on each finger, and has her hair parted to her left. The white female in the foreground is wearing the dumbest orange wristband you could possibly find for an office setting such as this. The African American female appears to be counting on her fingers, possibly counting the seconds it was taking the photographer to capture this bland and boring scenario on his potato quality camera.","This photograph is of a group of caucasian females painting what appears to be a swirling space mass onto a brick wall. This photograph is already immediately more interesting than the last, as there's something actually happening as opposed to nothing at all. The painting starts off darker at the edges and gradually gets brighter towards the center. This leads me to believe that what they are painting is a mass of gases orbiting a start in space. In the foreground, there's a female holding the finished reference picture that they are all copying down. Also in her hand is a cup that appears to have paint around where she would be drinking, which I think is absolutely disgusting and completely unsanitary. It's worth mentioning that according to the reference picture, the painting on the wall is far from finished and will indeed likely take a couple more hours at least. Also worth mentioning is that the female most properly framed in the photo is wearing her hat backwards, which indicates she has no idea how hats work since the brim is meant to keep the sun out of your eyes rather than off your hair. Everyone in this photo appears to be wearing similar clothing, which is white shirts with minimal graphics and black shorts.

The one standing has on a white baseball cap and white sneakers with no socks. All three painters are standing on a white drop cloth, but no paint appears to have been spilled yet. The recreation has been outlined in white chalk with the women filling in the colors with paint, and it appears to be nearly complete. There appear to be some outlets on the brick wall, but those have not been painted over.

The woman in blacks use of hand gestures and touching the back of her hair tell me that she may be frustrated with something that the woman in purple did. The woman in purple's focused look, while also nervously fidgetting with her hands tells me that she knows she is in trouble and is just trying to be quiet and pay attention to everything the woman in black has to say so that this verbal punishment can end as soon as possible. It is also important to note that in the background a projector screen can be seen, this can indicate that the group just finished a presentation of some sort and the woman in purple is simply nervous about receiving her feedback from her boss, resulting in her fidgeting during the conversation.","There is a person, dressed in running shorts, a T-shirt, and a backwards hat, that is painting a mural on the wall.

There is an orange wristband on one of the female's wrist, this may indicate it is an orientation event and the orange wristband may have had something to do with that. Or, the orange wristband means there are drinks in the area and you need a wrist band to prove you are 21. Or, the orange wrist band means this group of people are in charge of an event and you need a wrist band to get in. The two males in the photo are talking amongst themselves, while the two females are discussing something. The female with the wrist band appears nervous, you can't see her face, but she's runing an arm through her hair.","Three people are painting a mural on a dark blue/purple wall.

The mural is an abstract photo of a galaxy and they are about 9/10s of the way complete. The painters have a little left to do on top and are currently finishing the bottom.

What is happening in the picture is a young african american female wearing a pink or magenta dress holding a clipboard is discussing something about the following and/or previous meeting with a young white female in a black dress, who has an orange wrist band on. There are also two young white males in the background of the photo. One being slightly taller with darker brown hair, and a pretty pale complexion wearing a pink shirt and light kahkis. The other being shorter, maybe a little heavier, with a blue shirt on and darker kahkis than the former male, with dirty blond hair and a very fair complexion that makes his face look flushed. I would say that the main focal point of this picture is the young african american female because she is the most in focus and central to the overall picture, whereas the young white female is slightly blurred and off center.

The person holding the reference paper seems to be a young white female, fairly thin judging by her hand structure. She has brown hair that looks to be shoulder length, although she is out of frame and very close to the camera so an accurate description is impossible. The main person depicted in this picture is another young white female, with blond hair that is put into a ponytail. She has a backwards hat that is an off white color, she's wearing a male cut t-shirt, black shorts and what look to be older shoes. I would assume she's wearing this attire so as to not ruin any decent clothes with paint stains and such. She also has a blue surgical glove on her hand, which again I would assume is their so that she doesn't get her hands covered in paint. There is a third person is knelt down on the ground. It's not possible to determine the gender of this person.

The picture focuses mainly on the females having a conversation, specifically on the African American woman in a pink dress. While they are in a work environment, and dressed as such, the setting in the office/workplace between the two male workers is seemingly casual, with no visible tension or urgency between the two male workers. The woman in focus seems to be listing something off to the other female worker, and the expression on her face seems slightly stern. The secondary female worker is running her hand through her hair in what looks to be an uneasy expression. This could represent the woman in focus as being the boss of the woman in a black dress, giving out directions or relaying out negative information, or another coworker listing off something possibly urgent or stressful that is work related.

We can't see the door because it is pushed all the way into the other room. We can't see the top of the doorframe or the bottom because we are zoomed in a bit into the room beyond the doorframe. In the other room there are four people standing by the door. They are two men and two women. The women are closer to the door and the men are right behind them. The women are talking to each other.

One woman is white. She is young. She is wearing black pants or dress (we can't really tell) and a black short-sleeve top. She has a fluorescent orange wrist band or watch on her right arm and she moving her right hand through her shoulder-length dark brown hair. Her other hand is at her waist holding a card of some kind while the hand is gesturing with the palm up.

The other woman that she is talking to is black. This other woman might be in her thirties. She is wearing a purle short-sleeve dress and she is clutching a clipboard over her chest and she is playing with her fingers. She has on a blue watch on her left wrist and on her right wrist she has an orange band the same color as the band the white woman is wearing. This band might be for proof that you are a part of some conference or something, the kind you need to come back to an event if you have to leave for a moment. The women are both a similar, medium height.

Right behind the two women, there are two men talking to each other. One man is a few inches taller than the other. He is on the left and we can see his back and he has his head turned toward the right facing the other man, so that we see his profile. He is wearing a pink shirt that looks like it is probably a button-down shirt, and khakis. He has short dark brown hair. He might be in his early twenties.

The other man is facing him and talking to him. We can see his face but most of the back of his head is behind the wall and so is most of his body. We just see that he is wearing a light blue button-down shirt and pleated khakis. He has light brown or dirty blond hair.We see just a small part of his hair and it is slightly out of focus. He looks very young. Maybe in his teens.

Behind the men, at the other side of the room, and out of focus, we can see a television that is displaying some graphics for the intro part of some TV show. This and the little bits of furniture that we can see in the small negative spaces between all the people is very blurry and out of focus.

It looks like a conference or meeting just got finished up and they are all about to leave but have a few more things to ask each other before they go. The black woman looks older than the others and her clipboard makes her look more authoritative. She might have been the &quot;teacher&quot; or the person in charge of the event.","We see an over-the-shoulder type of picture where we are looking over the shoulder of a woman who is holding a picture or print-out on a piece of paper. The picture is in the center of our view. The picture is of a milky way galaxy-type shape but more stylized and with bright pastel and deep blue and purple colors. In front of the women holding the picture, three people are painting that same galaxy image onto a wall. Two of the people, probably students, are kneeling and we can't see them because the picture the women is holding is covering most of them. Another student is standing and we can see her apply paint to the center part of this &quot;mural&quot; on the wall.

The wall is made of stone blocks like a typical high school wall. The background of the galaxy mural is a dark blue, though in the picture the woman is holding, the background of the galaxy design is black. The mural on the wall is probably about 70% complete. The background is completely blue and finished, but the foreground parts of the galaxy design still have some outlined areas in gray that aren't filled in yet.

The woman who is the subject of our &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; view is also holding a red solo cup that was used to hold paint. We can see a lot of different paint got on the insides and edges of the cup. She is holding the picture of the galaxy design and the cup with the same hand.

The wall that we're looking at has some tarp underneath it on the floor to catch any mess. We can't really tell if this is an outside wall or an inside wall because the wall fills most of the picture and the woman's head and shoulder fill the right side of the picture. The only skin visible on the woman is her hand, because she is facing the wall and her hair goes over her shoulders. Her hand makes it look like she is an adult, maybe a teacher, and the rest of the people painting are maybe high school students. All the students painting I think are wearing white t-shirts.The student who is visible is blonde and wearing short blue shorts, and a white baseball cap turned backward. She has on one light blue latex glove on the hand she is painting with and she also has a red solo cup in the other hand.",10/1/2015,10/1/2015,2583,80.334733

The background of the phot is dark.  The interesting thing is that there are three people about 50 feet in front of the woman painting an almost exact replica of the photo onto the wall.  Two fo the people are obscured by the picture in the woman's hand and it's too hard to tell what age or gender they are though clearly they are adults.

The door itself is typical of one found in an insitutional setting rather than a home setting.  Both women are dressed professionally. Both women appear to be of average weight and height. The white woman is wearing a black dress, and the black woman is wearing a purple dress.  They both have long, straight, brown hair. The white woman is facing away, so her face is not visable. The white woman is running her right hand through her hair. On her right wrist, she is wearing a flourescent orange paper wristband.  This is the type of wristband that someone might have to gain access to a club or concert, something used to signify that one is permitted to be in the area. Her left hand is open, palm upward , and she has a small slip of white paper betwen her forefinger and middle finger. She is wearing a bracelet on her left hand, and she is wearing a ring on her ring finger. If this setting were in the United States, one could assume that the white woman is married. 

The black woman has a clipboard nestled between her elbow and body. On her left wrist she wears a small watch with a blue band, and she has a ring on the pointer finger of this hand. On her right wrist she is wearing an orange band that looks to be the same as the one worn by the white woman. She is wearing a ring on the ring finger of this hand. She is touching her left ring finger with her right hand. She is paying attention to the white woman. She is not smiling but does not really appear to be angry.

In the room beyond the doorway, a tall white man with short brown hair stands facing away.  He is wearing a light pink dress shirt and khakis.  His arms are crossed and his head is turned towards his right.  He appears to be having a conversation with another white man who is standing to his left.  The man on the right is blonde and slightly shorter than the man on the right.  He is wearing a light blue dress shirt and khakis and is facing the man on the left.  Only half of him is in the frame.

About one-quarter of the foreground in the left hand side of the frame is the back of a person's head. Only the left half of this person's head is in the frame. This person has long, layered brown hair which is resting partially on her left shoulder.  In the middle of the foreground, a thin white person's hand is holding a red SOLO cup.  Around the rim of the cup there are splotches of both yellow and blue paint. The inside of the cup is coated with light blue paint. The same hand that is holding the cup has standard size sheet of paper in between the fingers.  The paper is facing the viewer, and printed on it is a stylzed painting of something similar to the Andromeda galaxy or a hurricane with a dark background and white frame. The circle in middle of the painting is white, surrounded by spirals of purple, then yellow, then various shades of blue.  The outermost spirals are shades of purple.

In the foreground, a young woman is painting a mural on the a wall  that is identical to the picture that the other person is holding. The wall itself is composed of concrete cinder blocks which had been painted a dark indigo.  The young woman who is painting is white with long, straight blonde hair.  Her hair is mostly covered by the beige baseball cap that she is wearing backwards on her head.  She is dressed in light-colored sneakers, black sporty shorts and a white t-shirt.  She is facing away, but is turned slightly sideways, and her face is not visible. She is bent over slightly. She is wearing blue latex gloves and is concentrating on painting pale inner part of the spiral.  The mural she is painting is very large, taller than she and about the same width.  

On the floor of the room, a canvas is laid out.  It is speckled with paint.  Two people are on their knees to the left of the painting woman, towards the center of the mural.  They appear to be dressed similarly to the woman who is painting, but it is difficult to tell because the leftmost person is nearly completely obscured by the picture that is being held up in the foreground, and the other person's head is also obscured.",10/13/2015,10/13/2015,1878,89.117589

She was determined to make a good impression and show all of her coworkers how capable she is, but so far her confidence has been shaken. The office culture is insular and not particularly welcoming to newcomers, and Shannon is experiencing a great deal of discomfort and uncertainty. She feels awkward around her new coworkers, particularly Mike, the large and gregarious director of her department. Although Mike has been cordial, she can't shake the feeling that he seems not to afford the same respect to female employees as he does with men. All of her interactions with him have been short and strictly related to business, and yet his conversation about fantasy football with Dave is entering its fifth minute with no signs of slowing down. Furthermore, while she is trying very hard to convince herself that it's only a coincidence, Shannon can't help but notice she is the only nonwhite person on the floor, except for Robert, although he comes and goes since he is the building's custodian. While she is resolved to maintaining a positive outlook, she must admit to herself that this job isn't all she hoped it would be. Still, in a way it only strengthens her determination to prove to them that she belongs there and will not be silenced or set aside. She will earn their respect, whether they want to give it to her or not.","Julie is a high school science teacher in a rural community. Because the staff size at the school is small, some teachers have to teach multiple content sections. Julie has always loved art, and so she volunteered to teach an elective art course. Many of her students come from impoverished backgrounds, and most do not plan on attending college. As a result, many students only do the bare minimum to get by. Julie struggles to impress a love of learning on her students. Fortunately, the kids who have taken her art class are already fond of her personally and share many of her values. They are keen on helping Julie light the spark of curiosity in their fellow students. For their end of semester project, the class designed a mural to paint on one of the bare walls in the cafeteria. The design they ended up agreeing on is an artistic representation of the Milky Way galaxy. As the class works on the mural, many students stop to ask them what it is they're working on.

This photo shows a woman observing a photograph while a group of three individuals paint the same photograph on a brick wall in the background.  The camera angle is seen from over the woman's shoulder as she inspects the work of the three painters.  The photograph illustration appears to be of a spiral galaxy consisting of many colors such as blue, purple and yellow.  The woman overseeing the painting also appears to be a painter herself as she is holding a red plastic cup full of blue paint.  Therefore, it would appear to me that the four women are working together on this painting, perhaps with the observing woman providing direction to the other painters from a distance.

The picture is shot from behind one person who is holding the A4 paper to compare against the mural as the other 2 workers continue painting.  It appears that the mural is largely done and will require just minor touch ups from here.  This is speculation but it looks like the 2 painters are roughly of high school age while the supervisor may be a teacher coordinating the effort.",10/14/2015,10/14/2015,1399,89.782785

One female is wearing a black dress and seems to be a subordinate.  The other woman is wearing a purple dress and appears to, be, perhaps, a trainer. The female, wearing the purple dress, has a clip board tucked under her arm and seems to be counting out something using her fingers.  She is also motioning at something behind her, perhaps talking about something that happened in the training room.  All four people are congregated near the doorway; the two women speaking together and the two men conversing by themselves.  They appear to be standing in a training room, as there is a monitor set up with some sort of graphic and it appears to be a large, bright room.  The other female, wearing a black dress, seems to be asking for clarification about something.  She appears slightly nervous as she is fidgeting with her hair. The woman in the purple dress is listening attentively and has a look of understanding on her face. Both men are wearing dress pants and long sleeved dress shirts.  Their conversation seems more casual.  The man on the left of the doorway, is wearing a pink shirt, the man on the right is wearing a blue shirt.  The man in pink, has short brown hair, is the tallest of the group and he seems happily chatting.  The man in the blue shirt, is the second tallest of the group and he is listening with his mouth slightly ajar. ","This picture is very artistic.  There are three people in the picture, all appearing to be female.  The person is the forefront of the picture, can only be seen slightly.  You can see some of her from the back and she takes up the right side of the frame of the picture.  You can see half of her head, which is covered with short brown hair, half of her neck and part of her left shoulder.  She may be wearing a black shirt.  She is holding a red, plastic, tumbler which contains paint, possibly sky blue at this point. Also in her hand appears a copy of a picture that has a white border.  The picture itself seems to be of a galaxy.  There are many bands of color that form the galaxy.  The outer edge is a purple, then moves to a sea blue, then a light blue mixed with peach swirls.  Next to that the sea blue is used again.  A dark pinky/light purple starts to swirl as we get close to the middle of the painting.  It is surrounded by a bright yellow mass.  The dark pinky purple swirl has a white nucleus.  The two other people in the picture are trying to recreate this galaxy on a school wall.  They have first painted the wall a dark navy blue.  There is one girl standing and painting.  She has blond hair and is wearing a white baseball cap, backwards, a white t-shirt, dark athletic shorts and running shoes.  She is currently painting the white nucleus.  The other person painting is kneeling on the ground and she appears to be painting the bottom portion of the picture.  It's difficult to see what she is doing because the original picture that they are recreating blocks most of the girl on the floor.  There are two electrical outlets near the bottom left and right of the school wall though nothing is plugged in.  The girls appear to be painting this as a prop for a school play and they are almost finished. ",9/22/2015,9/22/2015,4576,38.520589

The woman in the black dress is asking for more information about the topics to be covered. The woman in Black is also giving the woman with a clipboard a note from the big bosses excusing her from the training today. The woman holding the clipbaord is annoyed that she is asking for more information before the training has even started, and that she will not be atending the training. There is nothing the woman with the clipbaoard can do but provide the woman in the black dress som highlights from the training and send her on her way.  The two men in the background are talking about how the training is a waste of time and how they already know what they need to to do their job efficiently. The woman holding the clipboard can hear this, as they are standing right behind her and expresses an annoyed look on her face. The men in the background have just made themselves a target in the womans mind. During the training she will be callig on them to answer most of her questions, which they will most likely get them wrong. As soon as everyone enters the training room the class will begin. ","A woman is holding a picture of a memorable storm that claimed the lives of thousands of people. She is watching over a couple of painters as they paint a mural on the wall of the exact picture. She watches over the painters making sure they get every outline correct. While it looks as though the woman holding the picture may be helping to paint becasue she is holding a paint cup, she does not have the skills to capture the essence of the storm. The woman is standing in awe as she sees the storm come to life on the wall. As people pass this mural they will remember this was the storm that changed the lives of many. Whether or not the storm had any effect on people that pass by it the woman knows it will mean something to her. The woman has a deep connection to the storm as it claimed the house she grew up in and was raising her family in. She becomes overwhelmed when the painters get closer to finish the painting. It is as if she knows as soon as this project is done it would have changed nothing. Her house and all her cherished memories she had in her house are gone. ",10/5/2015,10/5/2015,1483,61.527986

One of the workers is a white woman in a black dress. She's playing with her hair and holding what looks like a rolled-up piece of paper in one hand, or it could be a marker, or a piece of chalk. She's engaged in a conversation with a darker skinned woman in a purple dress, who is wearing a silver watch and also holding a clipboard. It looks like one of them might be explaining a problem to the other; it's not immediately clear who is mostly giving direction to whom, but they appear a bit tense and it seems their conversation is related to something pretty serious. Behind them there are two white men talking to each other, both wearing tan slacks. One is wearing a pink shirt, and the other is wearing a blue shirt. Their body language seems more casual andn their conversation appears to be a little more relaxed.","There is a person, seemiongly a woman, wearing a pair of blue shorts and a light colored shirt, as well as a cap, standing on some kind of elevated surface. She is wearing blue gloves, perhaps to protect her hands, and she is either drawing or painging some kind of unusual design. The design consists of a series of radiating, increasingly irregular spirals of color, white in the center, proceeding outward to brown or purple, then yellow, then blue, then green, and finally breaking up a bit into various more erratically shaped portions of several other colors, including turquoise, red, and some kind of darker purple. She's painting all of this stuff on what appears to be a blue brick wall. To her right there's some brightly colored object that's impossible to make out. Behind her there is another woman observing her, but you can only see the back of her head, part of her shoulder, and her hand. She's holding a red solo cup which appears to have paint in it, and is looking at a duplication of the painting the woman is making bordered within a rectangular frame, but it's really not clear exactly what this is, it sort of seems to be superimposed on the middle of the scene. It could be a smaller original painting, or it could be some kind of monitor. There's at least one other person crouched next to the woman who is painting. They're wearing blue shorts and a white shirt, but the rest of their features are obscured by the object that is framing the second painting. There could be another person as well, it's impossible to determine.  ",10/7/2015,10/7/2015,1533,6.952509

Lisa and Mark are artists. For their most recent project, they have been comissioned by a friend in Bed-Stuy to paint a cinderblock wall with a cartoon-style mural of some astral body. 

Friends gather as Lisa and Mark project the image on their blank canvas. The wall is first painted a matte Navy. Then slowly, majestically, the mural takes on a celestial aspect, like the milky way or a pastel egg being scrambled. Friends pitch in with solo cups of paint here and there, but really, it is Lisa and Mark's creation. They fall back, sipping their cups of beer and ocassionally paint by accient, watching art unfold in front of their eyes. 

The floor has been thoughtfully covered with drop cloth, as to avoid splashing it with paint. Lisa and Mark wear their signature matching white tshirts. The shirts are in themselves a canvas, the paint splatter a momento of the moment.

The background to this picture is dark blue, which I assume is the space that moves beyond. To other people, it might look like a hurricane warning sign; which shows how dangerous it's going to be. It can also look like a fallen crater that came crashing down to Earth, and got bits and pieces ripped off of it. Another example to describe this picture is; a model of the Earth's insides.

It features blue, yellow, sage, purple, and dusky pink, and is painted onto a dark blue background. The artists have laid down tarps on the floor to prevent paint splatters on the carpet, and they are working delicately with small brushes to fill in details. They are clothed in shorts and T-shirts, and the standing artist is wearing latex gloves and a baseball cap, presumably to keep from getting paint on herself. About three quarters of the galaxy painting has been completed, with the rest in outline. 

The woman holding up the picture also has a red paint-splattered plastic cup in her hand, probably for the artists to dip their brushes in when they are caked with paint. I can't tell what she is wearing, or if she is another artist.",9/30/2015,9/30/2015,1204,15.430986

The room appears to be well lit from daylight which would lead you to believe there are windows to the right as you walk in the room.

It is not finished yet, but the outline has been drawn in for all the missing parts. The void behind the galaxy is midnight blue for the mural. The standing woman is white and young. She is wearing short, black shorts and a white t-shirt. She has a blue, latex glove on her right hand as she paints the center of the galaxy with it. Her tan baseball cap is on backwards.

They are all young and professionally dressed.  One young woman is holding a clipboard and is talking to another young woman, who is wearing a black dress. The woman with the clipboard is wearing a simple magenta dress, a blue watch and several rings.  She is the only one facing  the camera, though she is standing at an angle and does not appear to be aware that a photograph is being taken.  The woman in the black dress is smoothing her hair with one hand and is holding a very small piece of white paper with the other.  Both women have shoulder length hair.  

Beyond them are two young men in light colored business shirts and belted, casual pants.  Their hair appears to be nealty cut and short.  They are both clean shaven and appear to be engaged in conversation.  There is a computer screen in the background, that appears to be displaying geographic designs.  Both women are wearing orange armbands, as though they have been admitted somewhere and the band is proof of their entry.  The men are both holding their hands across their chest and their wrists are not visible.   ","People to be painting a mural on a wall.  We are viewing the artists in the background.  In the foreground, a small but apparently exact image is being held by someone else (perhaps a woman).  She is holding the image along with a red solo drinking cup, that has been filled with paint.  In her other hand, she appears to be holding a cell phone, which is turned on.  We cannot see this womans face, only her hair and shoulder (facing away from the camera) are silhouetted at the right of the picture frame.

The mural artists appear to be working on an interior wall.  There are three artists, one is standing and two are kneeling.  All three are facing the artwork.  They all appear to be wearing white tee-shirts and shorts.  The painting itself is a spiral of color.  The other edges are purple, blue and some pink.  The center swirls are yellow and mauve.  All of these colors surround a white circle in the center of the mural.  Stylistically, it is modern and reminds one of a psychedelic comet.  The canvas (a simple interior wall) has been painted dark blue.  It's apparent that the picture has been sketched out carefully prior to painting, because there are outline marks on the wall itself.

A woman in a black dress looks as if she's discussing some sort of problem or issue with a woman in a purple dress. The woman in the purple dress seems to be someone in a higher rank than the other woman. The woman in higher power seems to be possibly listing things on her fingers, potentially solutions to a problem that the other woman may be encountering. The woman in the black dress seems to be trying to explain what's going on. These people clearly work in some sort of an office, as in the background it looks like a space as to which meetings are most likely held. In addition to the women there are two men standing behind the women. They are conversing with one another. It looks as though the women are standing right at the entrance of a door. So I'm speculating that maybe the woman in the black dress stopped the other woman in higher power to discuss some problem. They could also be at some kind of convention, as they all have the same fluorscent orange bracelets on. The woman in higher power has a rather stern look on her face.","There's a girl and two other people working on painting a mural on a wall. It's a dark blue concrete wall. The three people working on the painting are all wearing white t-shirts. Two people are kneeling down on the ground, I guess to get a certain area of the mural painted. One girl who has a white baseball hat on is wearing blue gloves as she paints. Then there is someone standing back a bit from the other people who are painting. This person who's standing from afar is holding an image of what the mural is supposed to look like it's a reference picture, along with a larger paint brush covered in light blue paint and a solo cup filled with the same color paint that is on the brush. The mural is quite big and takes up a large surface area on the wall. It looks like a spiral of various colors, but in my opinion it looks somewhat like a big galaxy in space. It's comparable to an elliptical shape. It's a very pretty piece of art. It includes colors of purple, yellow, lilac, and different shades of blue.

She had been pushing her friend to help her make some choices about what styles and designs that she should would want. Her non artistic roommate had told her she did not have a artistic bone in her body and had no time to worry about that, since she needed to pull in many more hours to pay for her half of the new rent. The painter had spent her own money for all the supplies and decided to make a design decision and use her 10 years of art school training and add something bright and original to their new home.

The other woman has a piece of paper wrapped around her finger and is holding the door, into which we are looking, open.  There is a computer or TV monitor on in the background, along with another one whose screen we can not see, that makes me think that this is either a meeting or presentation of some kind.  Although we don't get a great view of the room it appears to be very plain with white walls and little in the way of decoration.  The two women are both wearing orange wristbands which could indicate that they are at a convention or possibly a job fair where an entrance fee is required.

The picture that they are painting looks kind of like our galaxy with a white center and then bands of purple, yellow, blue, peach, and green surrounding it until we get into the dark blues of the outer reaches of the painting.  Judging by the type of wall and the appearance of the only person that we can see in this photo I would say that the wall is in a school, either a high school or possibly a university and is an art project for a class.  I have worked at school's in the past where murals were painted each year by the graduating senior class and I could see this fitting that example.  I think that I would describe the actual painting as an impressionists view of our galaxy as I'm pretty sure that's what it's based off of but it is different enough that I'm not sure.

The woman who's point of view we share is holding a copy of the mural on a piece of paper, and appears to be comparing the printed copy to the painting.  She is also holding a red plastic cup which appears to be holding paint. The galaxy somewhat resembles a top-down view of the Milky Way, as it is a large spiral shaped object with a defined center with various structures swirling around it. The background is navy blue, with the galaxy having purple, yellow, green and peach-colored swirls, with an off-white center. There are two people painting the mural.  Both are wearing white t-shirts and black shorts.  Neither of the women's faces are visible. One is a woman with long blonde hair, with a tan baseball cap turned backwards.

The center of the &quot;hurricane&quot; is a cream color and it is bordered by a light purple ring, which has borders that are not fixed, instead squiggling and moving out in large finger-like protrusions into the next color, yellow. The yellow ring is not fixed and perfectly round either. It has smaller squiggles in its border, but no finger-like protrusions. The next colors, which border the yellow, is blue and slate. Afterwards, the colors that surround the &quot;hurricane&quot; range from the pink, dark purple and dark blue. The colors do not have straight lines for borders, all of them squiggle up and down in peaks and valleys. The painting is not finished, as there are gaps in the artwork that have no color but do have the outlines of where the painters will have to color. The woman is wearing a light colored hat on backwards, a white t-shirt and black shorts. There is a side of a woman's head shown. This woman is holding a red cup with blue paint and looking at a tablet with the desired artwork will look like when it is completed.",9/26/2015,9/26/2015,1844,48.102371

It appears that they work in an office setting that is perhaps a media or tech-based professional environment, as they are all wearing typical professional white-collar attire. The two men are white and appear to be engaged in conversation with one another. The guy on the left is taller and heftier somewhat than his counterpart on the right. In the foreground of the frame, we see a white woman facing away in a black dress who appears to be talking to a black woman in purple. I say that the black woman is listening because her mouth is closed and her eyes are intent and focused as if she is listening to the other woman speak. The lady in purple holds a clipboard, leading me to suspect that she might be higher up in the company or at the very least an important colleague of the other woman. In the background of the frame, there is a large monitor with indistinguishable images on it. The images look like they could be shapes or abstract, computer-generated lines of some sort. This monitor makes me believe this could be a tech company of some kind. ","This picture is an artistic one about art itself. There is a picture within a picture, as a lady is holding up a picture of the mural artwork we see being painted in front of her. There are four individuals total in the frame: three painters and the lady holding the paint cup and the picture. Two of the painters are blocked by the picture, so you can only see the full body of the girl painting on the right. The work itself appears to be a colorful rendition of a galaxy, perhaps the Milky Way, as a spiraling, cloudy figure is seen extending ourward from the center. The color scheme is playful and features an inner white core and light purple ring followed by yellow, blue, pink, and dark violet clouds and rings coming out from there. The background of the mural is a dark purple/black, perhaps reflecting the darkness of the galaxy itself. There are some unpainted (but drawn) clouds at the top of the art work that still need to be finished, but the work looks to be almost entirely complete from this angle. The lady holding the picture might also be a painter, as she is holding a paint cup and is clearly posing for this picture. ",10/16/2015,10/16/2015,1259,71.701843

One of the women is wearing a dark pink dress, has a watch on her left wrist and is carrying a clipboard.   The other woman is dressed in black with an orange band on her right wrist which might be a watch.  The woman in the black clothing seems to be showing or handing a piece of paper to the woman wearing the pink dress.  The woman in black is fidgeting with her hair with her free hand.  The men seem to be wearing shirts and slacks although the view is somewhat obscured by the women.  The setting appears to be an office and all the people in view look to be under 40 years of age, smartly dressed and invested in their conversation.  The oveall view is of a fresh, clean, modern office environment and the office staff engaged in conversations relating to their particular field of work.

The other artist is in a kneeling pose and mostly obscured by the picture held by the third person.  The third person is not only holding the picture but also a cup with what looks like blue paint. This third person is only shown in profile and appears to be female but that is not certain.  The background of the mural is a dark blue and the mural itself appears to be an artist's impression of an astronomical galaxy.  The outer bands of the galaxy are depicted in a deep purple color.  The next layer is in a lighter shade of blue with the third layer in bright yellow.  The innter two layers are fawn and cream with the cream being the center.  There are some peach colored strokes around the outer layers.  The height of the mural is much higher than the head of the standing artist and approximately the same in width.

One woman has her back turned to the camera, the other woman is partially facing the camera. The woman whose face is visible is holding a clipboard and it appears that she might be gesturing to the other woman. The other woman is stroking her hair with her right hand, perhaps in a nervous manner. The nervous-looking woman is wearing some sort of bright orange bracelet which is blurred out by the movement of her arm in the photo. This gives her attire a somewhat more casual look than that of the other woman with the clipboard, who is not wearing any sort of brightly colored jewelry. It would appear that the woman with the clipboard is perhaps senior in grade or position to the other woman she is speaking to. There is a screen in the background, out of focus, probably a wide-screen TV screen that is showing an image that is too blurry to make out in this photo. The men in the background are both holding their arms folded in front of their bodies, and they look moderately comfortable with each other, but not too comfortable, as if they are work acquaintances making some sort of small-talk. They all seem to be near a doorway, as though they are perhaps just finishing or arriving at some sort of meeting or conference.  ","A person is holding a red cup with light blue paint inside. It is probably a woman, since the person has long hair, but I cannot be sure since only a part of the back of the head and shoulder of this person is visible.

The galaxy is colored in light blue, the same light blue as in the cup, as well as light purple, pink, and yellow. The woman holding the cup is looking at a picture of what seems to be the finished version of what the women are currently painting on the wall. It looks like the picture on the wall was outlined first, nad they are now filling in the sections with paint. Perhaps the woman holding the picture is directing the other women as to what colors to use in what sections. There is a dropcloth on the floor to catch paint drips. The two women painting are wearing the same colored clothing, white t-shirts with blue shorts. One of the women is wearing a white baseball cap, worn backwards, the other woman's head is obscured in the photo by the picture of the scene that the woman with the red cup is looking at.

The woman in magenta also wears a watch with a blue band. The woman in the magenta dress doesn't have much emotion on her face. She doesn't seem particularly pleased or particularly angry; instead, she looks neutral, almost like she's in tought as she listens to the woman in black speak.

She holds a red solo cup filled with a gorgeous light blue paint. She's also holding a print out of a colorful image, one that almost resembles a hurricane, on a white piece of computer paper. In front of her, she watches two other people paint a cinderblock wall. The cinderblocks have been painted a navy blue. Over that, the two painters work on adding a patten in a variety of different colors. They're adding a light green that's almost seafoam, two shades of purple, coral, yellow, and blue to the wall. Near the top, you can just see the stenciled outline of the pattern they have yet to fill in with color. It's the same pattern that appears on the white paper the woman with the short brown hair is holding. The painters are both dressed in white T-shirts and black shoes as they work to bring life to the presumably once-boring cinderblock wall. It is probably not unreasonable to think that the woman with the short brown hair is supervising the two painters as they work to closely mimic the swirls. ",10/10/2015,10/10/2015,1324,77.32617

Start by opening and placing layers of newspaper on the floor near the blank walls of your living room. Then pretend for a moment, that you slowly dip the entire length of your beard into a bucket of swirled paint. Most importantly, try to remember to keep the entire portion of your beard moving at all times to avoid making a streak across your neck. After one minute, walk to the center of a living room wall and position your beard in such a manner that it appers as if you are about to apply broad circular strokes with your newly acquired paint brush. Now just go for it. Simply begin  making small circles and gradually increasing in diameter. Once all the wet paint on your beard is transferred to the wall, return to bucket of swirled paint and repeat the same process again. As paint inside the bucket begin to diminish, you might be required to insert your face deeper into the bucket in order for your beard to touch the paint located near the bottom. At this point, it is best to pinch your nostrils with two fingers to avoid drawing up any residual paint through your nose. You can imagine how some might want to continue without stopping or taking any break. In this case, grab a ladder to help with painting larger circles that eventually reaches the ceiling height.

The women are talking to each other, and the same with the men. They are all fairly young and dressed in business casual clothing. One of the women is holding a clipboard. The other is doing some kind of hair organizing gesture. The two men look somewhat overweight. There is a computer or telelevision screen lit behind all of them out of focus in the background. They are clearly in for big business. 

The woman with the clipboard is gesturing as though she is listing things off and counting them on her fingers. She looks stern, almost as though she is confronting the other woman about something. One of the men looks somewhat amused. The other one looks very grim and earnest. The woman without the clipboard is white or east Asian with long black hair. She is wearing a black dress and an orange armband. The woman with the clipboard is black and is wearing a maroon dress and a wristwatch. The men are both white with brown hair and are wearing button-down shirts, one of them in very light pink and the other in oxford blue. Both of them are wearing cheap, generic khakis. The woman in the black dress is the only one whose face cannot be at least partially seen. She has something in her left hand, like a piece of paper. She is gesturing with her left hand in a way that is almost defensive. The central question this picture raises is about what is going on between the two women. ","This picture is somewhat confusing. In the foreground is the back of a persons head- all we can really see is hair, which is long and brown, and a hand, which looks feminine and is holding a red cup and a picture. The picture is an abstract design in yellow, white, purple, coral, magenta, and blue against a black background. It looks like a swirling galaxy of stars, but in a wide variety of colors. 

In front of the picture, three people are painting the same design on a concrete wall. They all appear to be women, but two of them are almost entirely obscured by the picture in the foreground, so it is impossible to say for certain. The third woman is leaning into the center of the painting holding her hand forward but does not seem to be holding a paintbrush. All three of them seem to be wearing the same thing, short black shorts and white t-shirts. The woman who is fully visible is wearing a backwards baseball cap and sneakers. She has long blonde hair medium-tan skin. She is also wearing one blue glove, on the right hand which is at the center of the painting. The wall's background color is dark blue. 

The design is not coming out very well. In the picture, the galaxy is tilted about 80 degrees along its horizontal axis. This did not transfer well to the two-dimensional wall painting, where the tilting effect looks nearly lost. The colors also fail to come together as harmoniously as in the picture. However, they still seem to be working on it so there is hope of getting this right eventually. ",10/1/2015,10/1/2015,1164,95.200274

The women in the foreground are both dressed professionally and seem engaged in conversation. One woman is wearing a pinkish violet dress and holding a clipboard against her body while the other is wearing a black dress and holding a sheet of paper between her fingers. The men have folded arms so I'd likely deduct that they don't know one another beyond a professional setting. The woman with the sheet of paper in her hand is also running her hand through her hair; a casual gesture, which leads me to believe that these two women may know one another or work together regularly. If I had to speculate, I'd say that they're just wrapping up a meeting, or just about to start. ","In this photograph, there are four people. Three people are painting a mural on a wall, while another compares the mural to a smaller picture of what it's going to be when it's finished. The person holding the picture also has a cup in her same hand that looks like it may have been used to paint. The painting is similar to a dopplar radar, except more colorful. It's almost like a spiral galaxy or a hurricane, but more gestural and with bold blots of color without blending. The enlarged image has a way to go before it matches the smaller version held up in comparsion. Only one person is fully visible in this photograph. Two are hidden partially behind the smaller version of a painting being held up by a person who's only visibility is their hand and part of the back of their head.

The fourth person is a young African-American woman, who is wearing some kind of purple dress, and is holding a brown clipboard in one of her hands.

Most of the people in the picture appear fairly emotionally neutral, although it appears that the girl in black might be kind of stressed or displeased about something. I think that these people probably all work in the same place - maybe they are interns, or entry-level workers. It looks like the business they all work at might be some kind of hospital or possibly something similar, although it is quite tough to tell with no other real context available.

The women are in dresses, one black and the other magenta. The woman in the black dress has an orange wristband on her right hand and a slip of paper in her left hand. She is stroking her hair with her right hand. The woman wearing the magenta dress has a blue and silver watch on her left wrist and a clipboard cupped between her left arm and body. Both women have dark, long and straight hair that is un-styled.

There is a drop-cloth protecting the floor from paint droppings.There is another girl, wearing a black shirt standing in the foreground of the viewing perspective. She is holding a red plastic cup filled with blue paint.

This smaller picture partially blocks the two kneeling girls painting in the background from the viewers view. The picture itself is in the shape of an eye or vortex, or both. It is being painted in very vibrant and contrasting colors. The the outside edge is a purple. The next colors inward are peach and sky-blue with a few streaks of magenta trailing from this inner ring to the outer. The color then transitions to yellow and a mix of purple and peach  surrounding the central eye or pupil that is a very light yellow or white. The picture the girls are painting is almost done but still has some stenciled portions that are unpainted. The smaller inset/held pictuure shows the completed work with all the colors that are decribed above.

One woman, wearing a backwards beige baseball cap and a blue glove, is applying paint to the center of the mural. The other two are crouched on the ground, mostly obscured by a ""perfect image"" picture of the mural they are applying.  It is unclear to me how this image fits into the space, since it has no visible support.  The mural is being painted on cinderblocks.  It has a dark blue background, and appears to be a representation of the swirl of the galaxy, if it were represented in grey-toned blues, greens, and purples, with accents of salmon and yellow. The colours are applied in broad organic stripes, with complex edges that remain very rounded and robust.  It very much looks like a Paint By Numbers project.

He has on a white hat that is turned backwards. His hair is blonde and in a ponytail. He is wearing a blue glove on his right hand. In that right hand he has a paintbrush. He is painting a design on a cement block wall. The wall is dark blue. The design is kind of swirled. Kind of like the Milky Way. The colors are purple, light blue, pink and yellow. He has first drawn the design on the wall and then is painting inside of his drawing. Kneeling on the ground to the left of him is a person that is probably also painting. They are wearing black shorts and a white tshirt.  There are two outlets in the wall. There is also a small painting leaning against the wall to the right of the man. In the foreground you can see the back of the head and shoulders of a person. The person has long brown hair. In their left hand they are holding a red cup with blue paint in it. In that same hand they are also holding a photograph of the design that is being painted. ",9/27/2015,9/27/2015,1220,42.454068

There are four people in the photo. There are two women who are facing each other and appear to be engaged in conversation. One woman is white and is wearing black. She is talking to a black woman who is wearing a purple dress of some shade. The woman in the purple dress is holding a clipboard and appears to be listening to the other. The white woman has her right hand in her hair, her right hand extended (holding a piece of paper between two fingers), and her back is toward the &quot;camera&quot;. There are also two men in the photo. Both are white men and one is the tallest person out of the four. He is in the background stationed between the two women and appears to be talking to another man who is off to the right and almost out of the picture's viewing area. There is a mounted monitor in the background which gives the impression that the four are in a conference room of some sort and may have been in a business meeting. All four are wearing business casual attire.","The picture includes three people. There are two people painting on a wall and a third person seems to be holding a poster of the image that is to be painted. There are actually four people in the photograph as you can see the feet of a 4th person behind the poster of the image that is being held. Two people are on the floor and both would appear to be painting. That is not readily proven because you can not see their actions behind the poster being held. The three painters all appear to be wearing white t-shirts. The main artist looks to be a female who is standing to the right of the painters that are kneeling on the floor. The canvas is a cinderblock wall that has been painted a shade of blue. The women seem to be painting a mural of some sort which looks like it may be related to space or the galaxy. The painting actually looks like something that one might see on a weather radar. The colors they have used in the painting are light blue, pink, another shade of pink, purple, and the center is white.",10/8/2015,10/8/2015,1265,32.73611

On her left wrist is a blue watch and on her right wrist in an orange paper bracelet. She seems to either be using her fingers to count, or she's fidgeting nervously with them. On her left hand she wears a band on her index finger and on her right hand there's a larger ring on her second to last finger. She seems to be in an office setting. There is a woman in a black dress standing to her side, who seems to be talking to the woman in the purple dress. She also has on an orange paper bracelet. The woman in the black dress is stroking her hair with one hand, and holding a slip of paper with the other, possibly handing it to the woman in the purple dress. The woman in the purple doesn't seem to be impressed by what the woman in the black dress is saying, and looks a little bemused. Behind the two women are two men engaged in a conversation in front of computer monitors. The entire scene is framed by a doorway. It looks as if we're peeking in on life in an office setting from the outside looking in. ","A group of three young people are huddled closed together and painting a mural on the large bricks of an interior wall. They're all wearing black atheltic shorts and what appear to be plain white shirts. You can only see the head of the one who is standing (the other two are crouched), a young blonde girl, and she's also wearing a white baseball cap, turned backwards. In one hand she has on a blue latex glove. This is the glove she's painting with. Her other hand is bare and is holding a red disposable cup. They appear to be painting a mural of a radar rendering of a large storm or hurricane. Most likely one that had an impact on the area where these people reside. The painting is composed of mainly cool colors, and it's almost abstract in the way that it swirls. The wall has large bricks, which added to the implied age of the people painting the mural, makes it very likely they're inside of a school. Behind the group of young people is a person, most likely a woman, facing them as they paint. She also has a red disposable cup in her hand, as well as a reference picture for the mural. She has long, brown hair. ",10/29/2015,10/29/2015,877,54.256337

Four people are visible, two of them men and two of them women. All of them are dressed in relatively formal attire. The men are wearing slacks and dress shirts, and the women are wearing dresses. They are all standing by a door entrance, of what could be either a college classroom, or an office. It is possible that all of these people might be employees at the same company.

The two men appear to be talking with each other, and are facing away from the viewer. They are located further into the room, past the door, and behind them there seems to be a screen, either from a TV or a computer. The two young women are also talking with each other. The women are facing each other, and the one to the right is almost facing the camera, whereas the other woman's face is not visible. The woman to the right is holding a document clip holder. The women are located between the men and the viewer, right by the door opening.

All these people seem rather engaged in conversation, and are probably discussing some details pertaining to work (if the setting is a corporate office,) or academic matters (if the setting is a college classroom or similar.)","This picture shows some artists. Two of the artists are painting a large mural painting on a wall, while the other person, which is closer to the camera and to the right, is holding a sheet of paper which represents the same design the two artists are painting, while also holding a plastic cup of what looks like blue paint. It is possible that the person which is holding the sheet of paper with the representation of the artwork checking how accurately the two artists have carried out the design (which is displayed in the sheet she is holding.) But it is also possible that the person holding the sheet might have painted or copied the mural in the wall in a sheet of paper, presumably for her own amusement or edification.

One of the two artists working on the wall painting seems to be a blonde woman. She is wearing a beige cap backwards, a white t-shirt, black shorts, and sport shoes. The other person's head is obscured by the sheet of paper being held by the third person, and it is hard to determine with certainty whether it is a woman or a man, although it is possible it might also be a woman. The second artist is also wearing a white t-shirt and black shorts.

The artwork that they are painting itself seems to be some kind of abstract piece, in which bold patterns of swirling solid colors (primarily blue, violet, and yellow, are in the middle of the wall, and somewhat resemble a spiral galaxy against a black or dark navy blue background.

There is not enough of the surrrounding environment visible to be able to determine the exact location or context. It could be a classroom of some kind, or perhaps some public facility. What is certain is that it seems to be a public setting, and not a private residence.",9/24/2015,9/24/2015,1459,92.800232

The room has an entry which leads into the well lit area with several TVs inside. Two men and two women stand near each other talking separately near the doorway. The two women both have brightly colored watches. The woman with maroon on is holding a clipboard and looks to be an important member of the team because of this. It appears the woman in black is listening diligently to the clipboard woman as she adjusts her hair. She is also holding out a piece of paper which is held  between two fingers. The two men in the back, behind the two women, seem to be having a candid conversion as the man in pink is smiling while speaking to the man in blue. It also appears that the man in pink is moving a lot while speaking as there is some motion blur. This means he most likely is moving his arms while speaking. This is a very common occurrence in males. It also seems that these two groups of people have no interest in each other as they are looking away from each other.","This is almost an inception-like picture of some artwork, which resembles a galaxy, and the people around it working on the art. The galaxy is many colors including blue, yellow, and purple and is very complicated with many different patterns throughout it. In the foreground a woman is standing holding a cup with some blue paint in it, a paintbrush with the same paint , and the final image of what they are working on. She seems to be comparing the actual mural to the picture they set out to paint. It appears they have put down a paint spill rag on the floor to prevent spills. This image almost looks exactly like what they are working on and almost gives a &quot;double-take&quot; kind of picture. Three other people are near the actual mural and are working on it by painting it by hand. It looks like they are using brushes to achieve the look they want. It also appears they are wearing clothes that they don't mind getting ruined as they have paint on it. They are nearly done most of the image and seem to be working on the edges and the middle to finish it up to the pictures standards.",10/12/2015,10/12/2015,781,56.294016

We can see a TV screen in the background, but it's impossible to see what its showing. There's a woman in a purple dress and she pays attention, quietly, to another woman who seems like she's talking about something in a very animated manner, by indication of her body language: she has one hand in her hair and the other one is moving down. This second woman, the one talking and gesticulating, is wearing a black dress, an orange bracelet and has her back half turned to us, making it impossible to see her face. As for the men in the background, both are behind the women and have their bodies half obscured by the women. The taller one on the left seems happy and curious about what the shorter one on the right is saying. Neither men is actually paying attention to the TV screen in the background. I have a sense that a meeting just ended and they are talking about what happened during this meeting. I would guess that the men are having a more animated and relaxed conversation, while the women look a bit worried and anxious about something.","There's 2 people in this picture. One is making a graffiti in the wall and the other one is far from the wall but very close to the camera. The one painting the wall, that is, making the graffiti, looks like a blond woman: she's wearing a cap, a white tshirt and navy blue shorts. She's also wearing a blue rubber glove on her right hand. The person close to the camera has his/her back turned to us and it's impossible to say if its a male or female. The hair is dark brown, above shoulder lenght, its wearing a dark shirt, holding a red plastic cup with blue paint inside and an image of what the grafitti in the wall should look like. The graffiti looks like the eye of a tornado, but has a bunch of nice colors, yellow, blue, salmon, purple, making it a nice and harmonious combination. To me, it's pretty clear that the person holding the cup and the image, the one close to the camera and with its back to us, is checking out how the work of the woman doing the graffiti its doing.

The man standing behind the woman in the black dress is the tallest in the room and is wearing a long pink dress shirt and light kaki pants. The man he is talking to is about 3 inches shorter than the other man and is turned towards the first man. This man is wearing a blue long sleeve dress shirt and dark kaki pants.

The employee to the left is explaining an answer in great detail. She is using her hands when she speaks. The body language with the two women employees in this picture is very strong.
The two male employess in the background seem to be having a carefree converstaion about anything.

The ethnicities of each person is: one African American and three Caucasian. In the picture, it looks as though the people are at work together. The African American in the picture is a female who is wearing a purple dress. She is talking to the other female depicted in the picture, and it looks as though they are talking about something very important, as the woman in the purple dress is holding a clipboard and looks very seriously at the other woman. The woman she is talking to is messing with her hair while she is talking to the other lady. I am not sure, but she may be doing this out of nervousness. Some people touch certain parts of their body when they are nervous, and that is what the woman may be doing.

Along with the two women in the picture are two men. They are talking behind the two women. They, too, look to be talking about something that is serious in nature. In front of them appears to be a television that is turned on. However, it is unclear what channel the television is on in the picture shown.","In the picture shown, there are three people. It appears as though someone took this picture of the other three people. For one of the people in the picture, you can only see the back of their head as if the camera man took the picture closely behind that one person.

The thing that she is painting is shown as a completed version in a smaller picture, which is being held by the first person that was mentioned earlier. The painting is purple, yellow, light blue, and pink. The picture also consists of several circles, making up a whole. The third person is crouched down beside the female who is painting on the wall.

The women are wearing wristbands, indicating that some sort of event is taking place. The woman in the magenta dress is holding a clipboard, indicating that she's in charge of organizing the event. There's a television in the background, and it looks like it's on FOX News, so this could be a political event. The woman with the clipboard looks like she's listening attentively to what the woman in the black is saying. Most likely the woman in black is saying something important, possibly pointing out an issue. You can tell from body language that the women are stressed. The woman in magenta has a look on her face indicating seriousness and concern, while the woman in black is touching her hair and signaling with her other hand that there is an issue. The men in the background are talking to each other, but it doesn't seem like the conversation revolves around work because neither seem particularly stressed. They have their arms crossed, which is usually stand-offish body language, but here it seems to indicate causalness.","Two people are painting a mural while a woman supervises. The mural looks like a very colorful version of the Milky Way. Some of the colors featured in the mural are purple, yellow, salmon, teal and blue.

The picture is taken over the shoulder of the woman supervising. The woman supervising appears to have her hair down, which idicates that she's not painting anything herself, but she's also holding a cup of paint, which is strange if she's not painting. The women painting are both wearing white tee shirts, which is not the best idea when painting, so most likely these shirts are old and the women are fine with them getting dirty.

It is very hectic because it looks as if they are getting close to a deadline and have no idea where to even begin with their project.  The lady in the purple dress holding the clipboard is the team leader and she is talking to the woman in the black dress, asking her for ideas.  The woman in the black dress has some ideas written on a piece of scrap paper but she doesn't think they are very useful ideas.  She has been distracted because is is pregnant and has been tired lately.  The two men in the background have some ideas but they are both discussing it to see if they are on the same wavelength with their ideas.  They might have a good idea but will need to run it by the boss first before implementing it.  It does not appear to be going well because instead of just brainstorming everyone is just panicking about the deadline and are not coming up with reasonable ideas.  The TV is on in the background to give ideas for the project but no one is paying attention to it.  The door is open because the boss is about to come through the door to ask everyone how the project is going.  None of the people even realize that the boss is standing there because they are so wrapped up in thinking of project ideas.

If she can impress her potential boss, then she will be given the job and will be able to start paying back her student loans.  The people crouching and painting near the bottom already work for the boss lady, and they don't have as much to prove but are still trying hard to do a good job.  The boss lady is somewhat disappointed in the mural so far- there are many things in the original picture that are different sizes and colors than the wall mural.  She decides that she will give her intern one more chance to fix this mural to make it look like the original picture, otherwise the intern does not get the job.  The intern feels that the picture is open to interpretation while the boss wants it to look exactly like the original picture.  The boss lady feels that the picture is a lot more complex than the simplified version that her employees and the intern are painting.  She knows that anyone who looks at the mural will like it, but she really wanted it to look like the original picture.

Then there is a ring of purple, then a ring of yellow, then two shades of blue, then pink, and then pruple again at the outermost circle. In the foreground of this picture, a woman is standing.

The group appears to be in their late 20s or early 30s.  Everyone is dressed in business attire and they are standing in a room where the door is open.  The women are almost standing directly in the doorway.  The men are more inside the room and there is also a brightly lit TV monitor in the room they are in.  One woman, facing us, is wearing a plum colored dress and holding a clipboard.  She appears to be black and has shoulder length straight hair. Her face looks a bit serious. She is wearing a neon orange wristband on one arm and a blue wristwatch on the other.  She is speaking to a woman in a black short sleeved dress who is  also sporting a neon orange writstband.  The woman is Caucasian and is stroking her dark hair.  This woman has her back to the camera, so it is hard to see her facial expression.  The men are speaking to each other.  One man has a pink shirt and khaki pants and he has short dark hair.  He is much taller than the women, and the other man.  The camera displays his back and a side profile, because his head is turned.  The man he is speaking to is wearing a light blue shirt and khaki pants.

All four are wearing business casual attire and all of them look like they are seriously engaged in what they are doing.  All four appear to be in their late twenties to mid-thirties.  In the far background, we can see a television monitor on the wall and the bottom of a few letters of what is most likely a corporate logo.  The walls of the room and the logo are all painted white.  There appears to be another flat screen television or computer monitor turned sideways in the distance.  Both monitors are so far in the backiground that they are blurry.  No other distinguishing features can be easily seen in the room.

The two females in the photo are closest to the doorway.  One has her back towards the actual door and appears to be straightening the back of her hair with her right arm.  The arm is blurred even though most of the rest of the photo is clear, so it seems likely that the photo was shot while she was in mid-motion.  She is wearing a black dress and has medium length dark brown hair.  She is also wearing an orange watch or bracelet on the arm that is in motion.  It is hard to say which due to the blurring.  Since we can see her in profile and her head is turned away from the door, it is hard to tell what race she is, but Caucasian or Latino seem probable due to her skin tone and hair color.  The woman she is conversing with is facing the doorway.  She has a clipboard held to her body with her left arm and she appears to be counting off tasks on her fingers.  The bottom two fingers on her left hand are out stretched.  Her mouth is closed, so she seems to be listening to the female in the black dress.  The woman with the clipboard is a somewhat light-skinned African American with straight black hair that goes just beyond her shoulders.  She is wearing a dark magenta dress and a blue wrist watch.

Behind the women, two Caucasian men are also having a conversation with their arms folded and held against their chests.  The taller man is on the same side of the room as the woman in the black dress.  He also is mostly turned away from us, although we can see the profile of his face.  Both men are wearing khaki dress pants and the taller man is wearing a light pink dress shirt.  He has short dark brown hair.  The shorter man has dark blonde hair and is wearing a light blue dress shirt.  From our perspective, he is a little further to the right of the woman in the dark magenta dress and is mostly hidden by the doorway.  He is turned towards the man in the pink shirt, so we see him in opposite profile of the man he is conversing with.  The woman in the magenta dress is the only person who is turned towards us.","In this photo, we are looking over the left shoulder of someone who is hodling a red plastic cup full of light blue paint and a photo or print-out of a piece of modern art.  Almost a quarter of the right side of the photo we are looking at is taken up by the person whose shoulder we are looking over.  The red cup is about one third of the way in from the left side of the photo we are looking at.  Based on the size of the cup, the dimensions of the print-out is about 8 inches wide by 6 inches tall.  It is hard to say whether the person holding the cup is male or female, although the hand looks slightly feminine.  The skin is light olive colored.  The person has straight, dark brown hair that just covers the left shoulder.  Only that shoulder, the left hand, and a third of the back of the head can be seen for this person.  He or she appears to be wearing a black shirt, although it is hard to say the color with certainity because of blurriness and the hair.

Based on the crispness of the detail, the camera was focused on the print-out in the person's hand.  The artwork on the print-out is being reproduced by two people on a much larger scale on the concrete block wall that the person holding the print-out and cup is looking at.  The wall is also slightly blurry.  The print-out is being held behind the red cup and it has a white border of about a half-inch.  The artwork in the print-out shows an artist's impression of a swirling galaxy painted on a dark blue background.  The color pallette is mostly purples and blues with orange highlights and a white or cream colored center and one large yellow area close to the middle.  The center of the galaxy is approximately the center of the print-out.  Due to its orientation in the print-out, the galaxy looks approximately like a egg with the smaller end touching the upper left corner of the print-out and the wider end touching the bottom right corner.  The artwork is very two dimensional with large areas of solid color and no gradiation of tone.  The style is most reminiscent of Impressionism.

The large reproduction of the artwork on the concrete wall is very close to being completed.  It covers the wall from top to bottom.  There is a beige drop cloth on the floor and two electrical outlets or small pipes on the wall being painted,  The two outlets are about five inches up from the floor and have small light colored squares with dark circles in the center of each.  There is about 6 feet in space between them.  The entire wall has been painted a dark blue to match the dark blue background of the artwork excpet for these two small squares.  There are outlines of the few incomplete sections of the artwork in the upper left quadrant of the wall that still need to be filled in.  Most of the rest of the galaxy has already been reproduced.  There is also something else that is light blue and two colors of beige on the floor of the room.  It is mostly hidden by the person whose shoulder we are looking over, so it is not possible to tell what this object is.  

Both people who are reproducing the artwork are wearing dark colored shorts and white t-shirts.  They both have light colored skin.  One person is kneeling on the floor.  We cannot see exactly what this person is doing because the photo of the original artwork is hiding all but the lower back, left arm, and part of the legs.  We also cannot see enough detail to determine the gender of either person painting.  The other person who is painting is standing up and is wearing a white baseball cap with the brim turned to the back.  He or she appears to have long blonde hair.  This person is wearing a light blue glove on his or her right hand and is holding a red cup of paint in the other hand.  The standing person is painting the light purple area just outside of the center of the galaxy.",9/27/2015,9/27/2015,2157,98.624415

The woman in the black dress seems to be saying something to the woman holding the clipboard.  The woman with the clipboard's body language and facial expressions indicates she is quite interested in what the woman in the black dress is saying to as she is making direct eye contact.  Inside the white room, there is another conversation being held in the background by two young men, both wearing collared shirts and khakis.  It does not appear as these two young men are long time acquaintances as the both have their hands cross and approximately three to four feet of space between them during their conversation.

A brunette woman in a black dress stands with her back mostly turned to the camera, her right arm raised and bent at the elbow, with her hand clutching a portion of her hair just at the top of her neck. Her left arm is more extended, her hand holding what appears to be a rolled-up piece of paper between her middle and index fingers. She is seemingly speaking to the other woman, also a brunette, whose complexion is darker. She is wearing a magenta dress and facing the camera, though her eyes are fixed on the brunette woman. The woman in the magenta dress sports a light blue wristwatch, holds a clipboard close to her chest with her left arm, and seems to be stretching or keeping count on her left ring and pinky fingers by touching them with her closed right hand, arm bent at the elbow and pressed against her hip. 
Behind the two women are two men, also engaged in conversation. A tall, cleanly-shaven man stands behind the two women, the back of his pink button-up shirt and right leg of his khaki pants the only part of his attire that aren't obstructed by the brunette woman clutching her hair. He has his head turned to the right, showing a complete facial profile as he is engaged in conversation with the second man in the photo. This man, who is seemingly a few inches shorter than the man in the pink shirt, is wearing a light blue button-up shirt tucked into a darker pair of pleated khakis. The frame of the door almost perfectly bisects this man's profile, beginning just behind the eye, leaving his ear, shoulder and backside obstructed from view. His arms seem to be crossed, but the woman in the magenta dress is obstructing the view of his left elbow.

In the foreground of the picture, a woman stands with her back to the camera, her head and shoulders occupying only the right third of the frame, and slightly out of focus. Her raised left hand clutches a red plastic cup with light blue paint coated on the inside and splashed slightly beneath its lip, alongside three similar yellow splashes. 
She holds a paper copy of the mural seemingly between her fingers and the cup, which obstructs the bottom left part of what looks to be the finished design. The design on the paper looks like what's being painted on the wall, only with more splashes of the same colors.

The walls of the room behind them are white and textured, so it's likely some sort of office building and not anything really important.

It looks like the mural is about 3/4ths complete. There is also a sheet on the ground below the mural to protect the floor from getting covered with paint. I imagine that this mural is in a school or a community center of some sort. The mural looks very similar to the photo that is being held up!",10/16/2015,10/16/2015,1232,26.557239

It is a very colorful image containing white, yellow, light purple, pink and two different shades of blue.  The entire image seems to have been transcribed on the wall before the artists started painting.

The confident people around her make her loose focus of what she is doing and she is struggeling to regain her composure. In this image she is standing in front of an open office door. It is a company which embraces technology and has a younge vibe to it. The picture contains 4 people, two men who are wearing kacki pants and light colored shirts, indicitive of a professional organization that does not have a lot of customer facing interactions. The women, one who I previously said was in Fuscha, and the other is in a simple black dress. ","This picture is of a younger artest transposing a somewhat abstract painting of the universe onto a brick wall (probably cinderblocks). The primary colors of the art are blues and yellows but there is a decent amount of purple in the image. The painting he is transposing from is a rather small piece, probably 3 by 5 or so. The main artist is wearing a canvas painters cap, white t-shirt and short dark shorts. There is a second artist who is working more behind the smaller image of the unicverse. he/she is simalarly dressed. There is also a person in the forground of the uimage a woman with a brounette bob cut hairstyle holdign a red solo cup filled with blue paint. We can only see the back of her head and her hand.

Woman A is comparing the mural currently being worked on to the picture in her hand that shows what the mural will eventually look like when it is finished. The mural itself is a colorful swirling mix of yellow, white, purple, pink, and different shades of blue that come together to create an artful representation of a galaxy.

The room looks like it is large and open with high ceilings and white walls. In the center of the room are 4 television displays suspended in the air, one facing each side of the room so that people in the room can view the monitors at all times. The two pairs of people talking to each other are standing right in front of the doorway that enters the room, most likely from a hallway. The first pair is a darker tanned woman in a black dress speaking with a lighter skinned woman in a purple dress. The woman in the black dress is about the same height as the other woman, but maybe a little taller. She seems to be an employee of the woman in purple, as the woman in purple is holding a clipboard and listening to what appear to be a set of questions that the woman in the black dress is asking. The other pair is two gentlemen, both caucasian, wearing khaki pants, but one is sporting a pink long sleeve shirt while the other has a blue long sleeved colared shirt. It is hard to tell, but it looks like they are both employees discussing something that may or may not be business-related. Their stance is a little more lax and shows more of a recreational talk as opposed to the more serious stature that the women have in their conversation.","In this image there are three, possibly four people involved in painting a picture on a brick wall. The room is somewhat small with a paved ground and a blue cinder block wall. The artists have placed beige colored sheets on the ground to protect the floor from being spattered with paint. The four people involved all look to be women. Three of the artists are at the wall painting the picture while one of them is standing behind them holding a picture of the image they are painting on the wall. Two of the artists are being blocked by this image, so it is unclear as to whether they are male or female. The woman holding the drawing is also holding a red plastic cup that is filled with blue paint. The last artist who is not blocked by the drawing is painting the wall with purple paint. She is a blonde haired woman wearing a beige hat, black short shorts and a white shirt. All but the woman standing behind the others appear to be wearing white shirts and black short shorts as well. It is impossible to tell for the woman standing behind as the only part of her that is visible is half of the back of her head, showing only her long brown hair. The image that is being painted on the blue brick wall looks like a spiral galaxy that is composed of blue, yellow, pink, white and purple colors.

There are two men standing in the background facing one another deep in conversation. They are both wearing khaki pants with a shirt and tie. In the foreground of the picture there are two women facing one another, but the tone of their conversation takes on an entirely different feeling from what I can surmise.  There is a woman in a magenta dress holding a clipboard and gesturing to her middle finger with the alternate hand as if to indicate she is in the middle of a lengthy list of negative feedback for the younger woman in the black dress-whose face we cannot see.  The body language of the subordinate would indicate she is highly uncomfortable to receive any sort of criticism in public. She runs her hands through her shoulder-length brown hair nervously as she leans up against the door frame. I get the feeling if she could manage to slink backwards several yards more she would, alas, there was no room to retreat any further and ensure the two somewhat handsome men nearby would not hear her being reprimanded.  She feebly tries to explain herself to her manager but the strained look on the supervisors face would indicate a bit of frustration with the performance of this worker.

You can tell they are inside somewhere probably from the power outlet to the left and right of the painting.

She was focused on what the woman in black was saying, but she looked bored, tired. She played with her fingers absently as she listened. Behind them were two men. One spoke eagerly, gesturing to something hidden by his tall frame. The other man looked like he had a question or two and was waiting for the first man to finish so he could ask.

It's as if she is standing back to study the picture to make sure it's being painted properly on the wall. There are three people painting at the moment.  One is definitely a woman, but the other two are hidden by the photograph that the woman in back is holding so it's difficult to determine their sex.  The mural is being painted on a wall that could very likely be in an elementary school or in a day care.  It looks like a depiction of a solar system, but done with very bright colors, which would appeal to little kids.  They are only partially done painting.  You can see some of the outlined areas on the wall that haven't been colored in yet and in the picture the woman holds there is a lot more detail than what is up on the wall.",10/6/2015,10/6/2015,1751,33.559916

In her opposite hand she is holding a folded or rolled up slip of paper.  The other woman is African-American and wearing a purple dress.  She is facing the camera and is carrying a clipboard.  The woman in the purple dress looks like she is engaged in conversation with the woman in the black dress, although it doesn't look like she is currently speaking.  Perhaps she is listening to something that the woman in the black dress is saying.  The woman in the purple dress is fidgeting with her fingers while she listens.  The two men behind the women are standing with their backs to the camera, but they are facing each other so their faces are in profile.

Also in her left hand is a red solo cup that has blue paint in it.  In front of the brunette woman is a cinder block wall.  The wall has been painted with a design that matches the design on the photograph that the woman is holding.  The photograph is being held in front of the wall in such a way that allows the design on the photo to line up directly beneath the design on the wall.  Currently, three people are working on the design.  A girl in black shorts and a white t-shirt is holding a red solo cup in her left hand and painting with her right hand.  Two additional painters are working on the wall, but they are kneeling down and are partially blocked from view by the photograph in the brunette woman's hand.  The wall mural is not yet complete because you can see where the design has been traced but not yet filled in with paint.

This person is also holding a cup full of paint that matches some of the colors used in the mural. The three artists are dressed in white and black, which could be a uniform for an organization such as a camp. The mural itself is slightly abstract in design, but seems to depict the Milky Way Galaxy. It is abstract because the color scheme used is not one that would denote an outer space scene.

The ring on her right hand is on her ring finger, while the ring on her left hand is on her pointer finger. As she listens to her co-worker she is playing with her hands and displaying a look that shows she is interested in the conversation.

The image that they are painting comes from a picture they have and is being used to recreate over the wall. In the forefront of the picture is a female that is standing off to the right. You can only see the side of her head and shoulder, as well as her hand in the bottom center of the picture. She has long, brown hair that goes down over her shoulder. She is holding a red, plastic cup that appears to have blue paint in it. On the outside rim of the cup are remnants of dried blue and yellow paint. Behind the cup, she is also holding a small photograph of the image that is being painted. The photograph is clear and appears to be the main focal point of the picture. In the background you can she one painter to the right of the photograph, as well as another painter on bended knee that is partially covered by the photograph. You can tell that the photograph was first traced on the wall as there are still white outlines that have not been painted over as of yet. The image itself appears to be a cartoonish image of a universe from a distant view. It is a blending of colors that would appear to be wrapping around in a counter clockwise circle. In the center is a white oblong shape and it is surrounded by purple. Outside of that, you can multiple colors wrapping around each other. Starting from the inside out are: yellow, blue, green, orange, and purple. The colors do not wrap uniformly and sometimes appear in different patterns.

The photograph has been taken from the other side of an open doorway, with blank walls bracketing the left and right sides of the image. Two adult women comprise the focus of the image, with two adult men clearly visible in the background. The women appear to be engaged in conversation, as they are facing each other and their body language indicates they are reacting to what is being said. The woman on the left is a Caucasian woman who is turned away from the camera, shoulder-length dark hair and wearing a black dress. Her left hand is presented palm-up at waist height, with a piece of paper between her index and middle fingers that she appears to be handing to the other woman. Her right arm is blurred with motion as she appears to be smoothing back or playing with her hair, with her arm extended at a 90-degree angle to the vertical, elbow pointing forwards, and her forearm bent towards her own face. She is wearing a wristband. The woman she is speaking to on her right is a woman of presumed African-American descent, with her arms somewhat stiffly at her sides and clutching a clipboard to her body with her left arm. She has straightened black hair of shoulder length and a neutral expression. She is wearing two rings, a wristwatch, and appears to be either fidgeting or counting off the fingers of her left hand with her loosely-closed right hand. She is wearing a purple dress. Behind them, two taller Caucasian males with short brown hair and wearing dress shirts and khaki pants appear engaged in a more casual conversation. At least two large monitors can be seen in the background, out of focus against a white wall.","The image is a photograph of a person painting a mural on a wall. It is being shot from immediately behind and to the left of someone with red hair who occupies the right side of the image. The person painting the mural is standing right of center, painting a galaxy comprised of distinct pastel colors. The mural has been outlined in its respective colors and the artist is filling them in, with their current focus being the white center of the galaxy. The artist is a Caucasian individual wearing a white shirt and black short shorts, wearing running shoes. They are standing bent to the left, with the right arm outstretched and the left arm brought in closer to their body. They are likely female due to the style of the pants, shape of the legs, and the wispy blonde hair poking out from under the backwards tan baseball cap they are wearing, with their face not visible at all from the perspective of the photographer. They are wearing a blue lab glove on their right hand but not the left. There are two similarly-attired people in the bottom center of the image, who are on their knees facing the painting, but who are obscured by a print of what is presumably the finished galaxy being held up closer to the vliewer, along with a Caucasian hand from offscreen in front of the print gripping a paint-stained red ""Solo"" cup. The print differs from the mural version in minor details, most notably slight differences in the colors used. The wall the mural is painted on is a dark blue with canvas sheeting visible on the floor to catch paint and what appears to be a paint-dipped short-bristled paintbrush in front of the redhead on the right side of the image.

The white woman has an orange bracelet on her wrist. Behind the two of them are two white men. One of them has on a soft pink shirt and the other has on a blue shirt. Behind them is some kind of monitor. The setting of this photo appears to be possibly an office or a hospital, but it is difficult to say which. The white woman in this picture is brushing her hair with her hand and fingers. This could be a sign of distress. While she speaks to the woman in the purple dress, the woman in the purple dress does not appear to be distressed but she does have a serious expression on her face.

I am the new programmer and project leader for the latest version of Animal Crossings interactive game under the Wii platform. In conjunction with the game, I am expecting to launch an app in the next couple of months that we think has great potential in the market place. As you know, you have come highly recommended to me by a friend of mine. She has worked with you in the past who feels that you would be a good match for our marketing department. In this position, you would serve as marketing coordinator of the company and we would offer you stock options in lieu of a monthly salary. We expect the profits for the first year to be approximately $7 million. I am satisfied with your qualifications so please let me know if you are still interested by end of business day. In the meantime, I have been informed by our human resources department that you have contacted another software entitiy that has similar potential to ours. I was told that a solid final offer from this company would garner the potential of $10 million in profits by end of the first year. Either way, I wanted to be honest and letting you know so that I would not waste our time. So I do hope that we can come to an agreement and look forward to hearing from you. ","First, before we embark on this vast journey of explanations, please remember that mass is the amount of matter, or &quot;stuff&quot;, in an object. Thank you. Okay, as you imagine in your mind, picture a black hole as a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light are unable to escape or get out. That's right. Try to visualize how this gravity can be so powerful, such that even matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This usually can occur when a star is in the process of dying. So because no light can get out, us humans technically cannot see black holes. If you think about it, they are actually invisible. Only certain space telescopes with specailized tools can help find black holes. These specialized toos can observe how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars. Now black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one single atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass similar to that of Mount Everest. As we head towards the opposite end of the size spectrum, there is a kind of black hole called &quot;stellar&quot;. Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of our sun. As matter of fact, there may be numerous stellar mass balck holes currently in our Earth's galaxy. However, the largest black holes are called &quot;supermassive&quot;. These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have provided us with proof that every large galaxy containes a supermassive black hole at its center. How cool is that?  ",10/13/2015,10/13/2015,347,8.323056

The other woman is Caucasian, and she is wearing a black dress with an orange wristband. The woman facing the camera seems to be listening to the other woman speak. Her body language seems kind of impatient and it looks like she is the one who is requesting information from the other woman. The woman not facing the cameras body language seems uncomfortable, since she is playing with her hair and her posture is not very good. She is standing slouched and it makes her look like she is defensive. There are two chubby white men standing in the background, each wearing khakis and button-down shirts. They both look young and perhaps are interns. In the far back of the picture is a TV with a blurry picture, so you cant tell what is on the TV. They may be standing outside of a break room, since I would assume the TV wouldnt be in a conference room or an office. Maybe they are all leaving after having had lunch.

The girl you can see is wearing blue gloves, shorts, a white t-shirt, and sneakers. They are painting an abstract picture, which uses purple swirls on the outside. The middle swirls are blue and teal colored, and the inner swirl is yellow with a cream colored circular interior.

The person holding the picture or tablet it also a woman, She's holding a red disposable cub in her hand with blue pain inside it, but I don't think she is one of the painters because her hands are clean adn don't have any paint on them.

A flat screen television or monitor is displaying some kind of information in the background, however it is unclear as to what that is. The information on the digital screen in the background is shaded mostly cobalt blue, with splotches of red and white in the center. The digital display is suspended on top of a clear, white wall. Closer to the foreground, two men appear to be conversing. The first man is a taller Caucasian man with dark brown hair. He appears to be somewhat overweight, but not too fat. He is wearing a light pink shirt, khaki slacks and a black belt. His full face is not shown, only that of his right side. His arms appear to be crossed and his face is turned to his right. The second man has his face partially obscured by the entrance. He is shorter than the first man and also appears to be Caucasian. He seems to be speaking, as his mouth is partially open while he is looking at the other man. The style of his attire is similar to that of the first man, except for the color of his shirt, which is light blue. His arms also appear to be crossed. In the foreground, are two women, who also look as if engaged in a conversation. The first woman seems to be of African desent, and has dark brown har that rests on her shoulders. She is wearing a dark purple, sleeveless dress, and is holding a clipboard. On her wrists are a silver faced watch with blue straps, and an orange band with a white label. She does not appear to be speaking, rather she looks as if she is listening while someone speaks to her. Her face is clear and unobscured in the photo. The second woman had her face obscured entirely. She is wearing a black sleeveless dress and has black shoulder lenght hair, which she is stroking. She appears to be talking to the first woman, judging by her stance and posture. Finally, the foreground itself, is the oepning of a doorway. The walls of the doorway are white with a silver door handle.The inner section of the doorway contains three bolts on both sides, each bolt spaced a few inches from teh ones above it. All four individuals in the photo are standing inside the doorway, and very close to the entrance, giving the the perspective that the viewer is outside of the room. ","In this picture, a person is recreating a painting from a picture onto a brick wall. In the background, a person is working on the painting. It is unclear whether the person is a male of female. However, it is clear that the person is painting. The individual is wearing a blue glove on the right hand, and a white cap, turned backwards, on the head. Also being worn by the painter is a white tshirt, with black (or another dark color) pair of shorts. The painter's head is tilted to the left side, and the painter's stance gives the impression that he or she is very engrossed in the work. The painting itself  is made of a multitude of colors, including many shades of blue, gray, yellow, red and violet. It is in the shape of a galaxy spiral, circling itself. The brick wall painting does look to be incomplete, rimarily because several outlines of the work are empty and without color. Beside the painter, are two indivinuals kneeling.The upper portion of their bodies are obscured by a copy of the same work they are trying to recreate. They are wearing the same attire as the first painter, white tshirts, and black shorts. It can be assumed that these two indiviluals are painters as well, because of this. It is unclear what the two kneeling individuals are doing, but one cans assume they are assisting the first painter in completing the work on the brick wall. Closer to the forground is a picture of the painting, that is already completed. It looks to be on a piece of printing paper, enclosed by a white border. In the forground is a shadowy indivdual. It is unclear whether this individual is male or female. However, the light source shining from above shows that this individual has dark brown or brunette shoulder length hair. Also in the forground is an disembodied hand holding a red cup, as well as the already finished image of the painting that is being recreated on the brick wall. The inside of the red cup is tinted blue. Based on the context, it can be assumed that the substance inside the red cup is blue paint. The disembodied hand is close enough to the shadowy figure that it is inferred to be the hand of the shadow figure. The shadow figure is standing off to the right corner of the image, leaving the viewer with a centered piece of the painters working on the painting. The lower portion of the brick wall painting, as well as the heads and upper bodies of the two kneeling painters are obscured by a photo of the already finished painting. The lower left corner of the finished photo itself is also partially obscured by the disembidied hand holding a red cup of blue paint. ",10/29/2015,10/29/2015,1707,38.253665

Beneath this tablet, at the forefront of the picture, there are two people crouching wearing white shirts who are assisting someone who is standing and painting the center of the mural.

The task itself is relatively important for the company because it shows the statistics of the past 2 years and having that knowledge will defintely help the results for the following year by determining strengths and weaknesses of the company's sale staff. Because of her unfavorable work ethic, the assitant is getting more and more frustrated about the task at hand and is beinging to worry that she may be fired. Her supervisor, although knowledgable about her past mistakes is willing to give the girl one final chance to turn things around. She is thinking, &quot;This may be her last chance to get where she wants to be in life and this may be the time she starts getting her life together.&quot; The dark skinned supervisor is very understanding and forgiving, sometimes more than she should be. ","This is the work of a very talented graffitti artist. The artist uses different bold colors to offer a general visual contrast within the piece but also arranges his colors specifically enough to where all the colors flow together really well to create a stunning visually compelling piece of illegal or comissioned street art. This piece is of a galaxy, possibly the galaxy in which we all exist. He or she is working from 'back to front', which is a method to approach painting more complex images where the artist starts by layering simpler colors that will eventually lead up to more complex colors, shapes and textures. the base layer, as it is usually called, generally just serves as a basic guideline for whatever image you are creating. It helps by giving the artist an idea of what the painting looks like before investing too much time into something being wrong. This method allows for mistakes to be corrected early in the painting process so that more efforts wont be made to correct mistakes that would have been made in the future, possibly delaying the finished product if not ruining it altogether. It seems like the artist is working on the base layer in this picture while having another artist, possibly a friend, to help with the proportions of the image being transferred onto the wall. Although the image itself is not too complex these methods are actually very important in any painting process and should be used by anyone that attempts to have a job in this profession.

The mood looks generally calm and relaxed however its also extremely serious and proper. Iwoudl suspect the gal with the clipboard is the high management while the other 3 are subordinates. The conversations look very serious however the group appears to mesh very well and almost feels like the individuals are comfortable with each other despite the serious nature of the business.,This picture took some time to really understand.

","Although her duties and obligations have changed from when she was a child now, there are certain aspects to her upbringing that has impacted her well-being today. Over the years, she has come to realize since her childhood years, that as a public school mural painter, she has shown better hand-eye coordination and visual-motor skill, such as her resistance to distraction, her sensitivity to information in the perpheral vision and ultimately, her developed ability to tackle long-term projects, more than other charitable public school mural painters. She has discovered that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with female beach volleyball atehletes, involving challenges that switch attention between different points of locations. Hence, here we see she is drawn to (no pun intended here) wearing the notable beach volleyball attire as a reminder of her lengthy journey to this point. Actually for her, the truth lies (again, no pun intended) in the fact that painting murals on a regular basis to support public schools that are clearly struggling, can also be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of varous mental health concerns, such as severe boredom by repetition as indicated in the 1980 film, The Shining, starring Jack N. playing Jack T.

The mural, which consists of a colorful rendition of the Milky Way galaxy, is based on a drawing that was made by one of the students, presumably the student in the backwards baseball cap. The painters are filling in the outlined mural with various colors. While they paint, their professor oversees their work, comparing it to the original drawing the mural is based on, which she holds in her left hand. We can sense the diligence of the students as they work on the mural, which is presumably a graded project, as their professor judges and evaluates their work. Although it is unclear, the professor appears to be holding a cellular phone in her right hand. This suggests that she may be somewhat distracted from her evaluation, or at least that her attention is divided.

She is dressed in blue short shorts, a white t-shirt, and a backwards white baseball cap, her right hand covered in blue paint and applyig gentle brush strokes to the wall. Kneeling to her left are two other people in white t-shirts and shorts, the top halves of their body obscured by the picture in the brown haired person's hand. It can be presumed they're painting the wall as well. The picture in hand and the muriel on the wall are nearly identical.

One conversation in the foreground is between two young women, one of which is African American and one of which is white with brunette hair. She has an orange &quot;temporary bracelent&quot; on her right wrist and is playing with her hair.  Perhaps she is doesn't really know the other person well and is a little nervous about the conversation or saying the wrong thing. Her counterpart is wearing a mostly blue with some white smallish stripes bracelet on her left artm and is holding a clipboard. Perhaps she is the facilitator of the smallish meeting (or there may be other attendees out of sight.)  or perhpas she is a manager or supervisor, and thus has some power over the other people there.

To her left and perched on her knees is another woman similarly dressed. This person is partially obscured by a large picture (maybe one sixth the size of the wall painting) that the artists seemed to be duplicating.  I can't tell exactly how it is supported, and it's possible it was photoshopped into the whole picture. In the lower right foreground is a somewhat blurry image of a person probably wearing a black top.  We see her (I think female but couldn't swear) relatively short brunette hair from the back, and also just her left hand holding a cup of blue paint, but she's far enough back from the others that she could not reach the walk to paint.  As for the painting, there's white, blue, purple, pinkish orange, and yellow.  It's hard for me to describe as it's somewhat abstract, but it's kind of a cross between a galaxy and a weather system you might see on your TVnews with different precepitation bands in different colors  I got the space vibe as the edges are all black. There might be a rotation going on from the small white center of the painting. That center is ringed by a light purple design with a few protusions. Next we have a yellow ring again not perfectly formed. From that point things get more irregular with blue, a dash of pinkish orange, and dark  purple.",10/10/2015,10/10/2015,1356,47.195831

The two males in the back are also engaging in a conversation, this seems to be pertaining to something that is in the male on the lefts direction, due to him facing away from the male on the right. Their location is one that fits the description of business as their outfits aren't at all casual and and their faces depict that of someone who is a professional settling dealing with something that is the opposite of engaging in a casual discussion during a friendly hangout. The background is wide and open, displaying that the place they are in is one that is large in both size and the width that it covers, something that also seems to be linked to the topic of their discussions with one another. The females are standing seperate from the males displaying that each is engaging in their own different professional discussions, this is carried across further due to the fact that their body language is only directed to the person they are looking at, instead of standing in a circle to where open communication can happen. The male on the left is blurred, showing that at the time of the picture he was moving to face a way, most probably to show the male on the right something that is in the background environment, although this is so, the man on the rights face is yet to look in that direction so the conversation hasn't yet gotten to that point between the two.

So, it is my belief that they all probably work together.  On the wall behind the two men, I can see a television screen connected to the wall.  Perhaps the television is used to play work related videos.

It is extremely tiring in the workplace to always keep positive and happy so I can completely understand. If the day is just dragging on and on and then you have to deal with incompetent people; it can definitely make anybody irritated. This picture describes just that, in my opinion.

In front of her are two other people coloring the same painting on a wall. One of the people is female and she is standing up. The other person is kneeling down and their face is covered by the picture of the painting. The painting looks like a universe to me. It has a spiral look to it and it appears to be in motion.  The wall that they are painting is dark blue. The woman standing up is wearing a blue glove and has a backwards cap on.  The colors of the painting go together very well. Overall the painting is very impressive and i would reccomend it to anyone.,10/8/2015,10/8/2015,2239,22.169451

They have just wrapped up a meeting about how to increase worker productivity. The lady in black isn't doing as well as most of her peers in her department. So as the meeting ended the lady in black was asking the lady in piurple about some of the key issues brought up during the meeting. The lady in black is frustated and is asking her boss how she can do better bring up her sales numbers. Her boss really likes her and is willing to help her in any way possible. Her boss starts to count using her fingers some key goals that she should set for herself. She explains to her that she should set small goals that are easily attainable and not huge ones that may take alot of time. The lady in black is listening nervously and she is touching her hair in a nervous fashion. The lady in black knows she could lose her job if she doesn't do better in the long run.,The young artist in the white hat has been hired to paint a wall in the science lab at a local highschool. She wanted to do something flashy yet scientific. She knew it had to very large to cover most of the concrete wall. So being the crafty person she is she drew the preliminary drawing on her computer. She then printed it on photo paper and presented it to the principal. The lady holding the cup is the principal in question. She loved the drawing and decided to help in any way she could. Most of the school had been remodeled at a very high cost to the county. Luckily the principal decided to hire a local artist for a much cheaper price than what a profesional may charge. When this is done they will be unveling the new science lab and will be holding a first ever tri county science fair. This will let many science oriented students show off there talents in the coming months. The artists use of colors really bring out the picture behind the blue backdrop of the wall.,10/11/2015,10/11/2015,429,1.608798

She has the first day jitters. She really wants to do well at this job. She wants to impress her boss and co-workers by doing a great job. I'm figuring she's about to meet with her boss for a small orientation. You know, just to let her feel welcome and give her a few ins and outs of the business. Her co-workers have been here longer than her and they seem to be comfotable around each other. Maybe she feels that she can also fit in as more time passes. I think she may have spoken to them on her way towards the office. She also seems to be the only minority employed at this company just from the picture. She thinks she may do a good job and fit in but there's still doubts in the back of her mind. She doesn't have the confident look initially but that may change over time. When she gets comfortable and interacts more, I feel like she would ooze with confidence and strive better to do a good job.","The person holding the cup of paint made this painting come to life. She hired a few people, got all the colors, found a blank canvas (a brick wall) and made her idea visible for many people to see. All from a small sheet of paper. She's happy about making her idea come to life. She was confident enough that it would work and it's finally manifesting into existence to where other people can see it. This makes her feel incredible. She appreciates the people who helped put in the work to convey her thought and bring it to life. It's exactly how she envisioned it. I feel this may be for a school or maybe even a museum of science like Ferbank in Georgia. She's probably going to get a good paycheck for this and benefit from other jobs hiring her as well. This is how to network and grow a consumer base, especially in the field of art. I feel like she has a great sense of accomplishment.",10/13/2015,10/13/2015,1272,27.299402

As a middle manager in the company, she wants to step up and be heard.  She feels as a minority in the company, that the upper level managers are looking to promote a female, African American to the top ranks.  She's had success before, but this new project could be her ticket to the top.  She fears that other workers at the company may not give her the support she needs.

One of the owners stopped by to check out the progress and brought along the design Nancy had made to compare the original idea to the actual product.  The owner was completely happy with the progress and was more than happy with how it was turning out.  Nancy was providing a great backdrop for the new room in the museum.  She was sure that the children in the room would love the splashes of color and was more than confident that it would be perfect for the setting.

It's an office setting, probably some kind of board room. There's a television screen hanging on the wall in the background. In the foreground we see the sides of the wall, and we are looking through an open door to the four people talking.

A dark skinned woman (possibly of African descent, though her ethnicity appears a bit ambiguous to me) wearing purple and a white woman in black are talking to each other. The darker-skinned woman is holding a clippboard and the white woman is assuming a somewhat abashed pose. It appears to me that the darker-skinned woman is in a higher position--though they may be equals in terms of company hierarchy, their body language indicates a subtle level of higher social status for the woman in purple.

Behind them, two men are also talking to each other. Both appear to be slightly overweight (or merely bulky), and both have their arms crossed. Both are wearing pastel-colored shirts, one pink and one blue. It is difficult to ascertain their status in relation to each other, due to the facr that the man in light blue is mostly obscurred by the wall which froms the foreground of the photo.","In the foreground of the photo, wee see a quarter of the back of someone's head, as well as their shoulders in the corner of the frame.

The person's hair is somewhere between mousy-brown and honey-colored. Though it is difficult to see at first, she is also holding a paint brush laden with blue paint--presumably from the cup--in her other and. It is just visible in the space between her head and shoulders. Nothing can be seen but one side of the back of her head and the objects she is holding.

The picture is held in such a way that it obscures the three people (presumable all women) who are painting a large reproduction of the design on said picture; they are painting it on as a mural on a wall. All three are wearing white shirts and black shorts. Two are kneeling and are almost completely obscurred by the picture being held up. The only visible woman is standing up and applying paint to the center of the mural. She has blonde hair and is wearing a beige basball cap. Like everyone in the photo, her back is turned to the camera.

The mural itself is painted on a wall made with large concrete blocks, the kind you would find in schools, prisons and other municipal buildings. There are two wall outlets on either side of the wall which are not being painted over, and the floor is covered by a plastic tarp so no paint will sully it. It is clear that this photo was taken indoors.

The mural is a multicolored spiral object painted in bight colors. It is a celestial cloud of pastel colors, a black hole that has sucked up too many easter eggs. The outer rim is purple, the inner spiriling blothces of color are blue, pink and yellow, and they are all spiralling around a white center over a dark blue background.

As the employees were gathering in the room waiting for the supervisor to arrive the conversation drifted to what the meeting could be about. There had been rumors for weeks about possible layoffs. There had also been rumors of possible promotions. Nobody knew what would come next. There was nervous laughter, that fake kind of laughter where you're pretending that everything is okay, but deep down inside you know something is wrong. Sheryl, in the purple dress, had worked at the company for 5 years now and had been promoted twice. She hoped that this would be the third time, but the rumors of layoffs shaded her optimism. The company's stock price had taken a hit that week, something was a amiss in the labrynth of paperwork that was being explored by the Federal Trade Commision. Tax shelters or phony earnings reporting. Something like that. Nothing that would ever effect her personally if it hadn't effected the entire company and put it at risk for bankruptcy. So now she awaits her fate, hoping she doesn't have to walk in the door tonight and put on a brave face for her daughter while knowing she has to find a new way to provide for her. Back to public school perhaps. Maybe downsize to a smaller house. Or take out a second mortgage until she could find a new job. The meeting was called.

Angie had put together the concept on a computer wondering how Da Vinci would marvel at such a tool. Now it seemed so easy to create. But was that a good thing or was the barrier to entry to the art world too low now? If everyone has the tools to create, if those tools have made art easier to create then how is greatness recognized? It was a dumb project anyway. Her art teacher, Ms. Lawson, has asked for volunteers, and after about twenty seconds of excurciating silence she had raised her hand. For the past few weeks she had been working with virtual paints to smear them together into a cohesive whole. The subject was diversity. She had been asked to interpret this however she wanted. She chose a galaxy, because what's more diverse, what's more inclusive than a million billion light years of stars or however big it was. She didn't know. Hey, she's not going to major in science. She's majoring in Art. With a capital A. Angie is going to be a serious Artist and this, in her mind, is her first big break.

The workers are working very hard to get this absolutely right. The woman with the cap is being very focused on the middle part of the painting and she has the role of painting that exact area. The other two painters have their own role as well. They are focused on painting the bottom area which could be a bit harder to paint comfortably. The comparisons are very much alike but there is still more work to be done and the workers look a little bit weary. The woman is holding a cup of pain where she could be adding more elements to the painting.

There is either a television or video screen in the far background.

The woman in purple appears to be upset with the woman in black, possible from missing the ""imposed"" meeting.  The woman in black appears to display nervous gestures, such as raking her hand through her hair, holding left hand palm up.

She is in the foreground of this picture.  Another woman (#2) appears to have blonde hair, wearing a cap, light-colored t-shirt and black shorts.  She has what looks like a blue glove on her right hand.  The other person (#3) is on his/her knees in the middle of the floor. Person #1 is holding a picture of artwork, and I'm assuming she is comparing to the wall mural that person #2 is creating.  I am unable to determine what person #3 is doing, as his/her torso is blocked by person #1's picture, but I'm guessing he/she is also contributing to painting the mural.  The wall in which the mural is being painted is dark blue in color, with an abstract creation of blues, yellows, pinks, grays, purples.

There is tension between the two, because they are both vying for the same position. However, they realize they need to work together to get a task completed, and if they don't work well together, it will be detrimental to both of them. There has been a lot of blame going around lately, and though they are in direct competition, they both want to make it clear they are not the ones flinging the blame. After a bit of a tense back and forth, they settle into a decent conversation and brainstorm a bunch of ideas as to how to get the upcoming task completed. They don't particularly care for one another, but they do have a healthy amount of respect for one another and they take each other's ideas seriously. After bouncing ideas off of one another, one employee asks the other if she'd like to sit down over lunch and discuss it further. The other agrees. They both leave this conversation a bit skeptical but assured that they will be able to get their jobs done in a good and efficient manner. There is no wonder as to whether the job will be completed. And, as tense as the conversation was, they both feel a bit more relaxed, now. It's out of the way, and the future looks to be a bit easier. ","This picture represents, in its own way, everything that has ever been. One could look at the photo or mural and see that this is how the cosmos has been operating since the dawn of time. Is the center of the mural a black hole, and is that the milky way spinning around the center of it? Or is the center a random star with planets and space debris revolving around it? But, the thing is is that this photo doesn't even have to represent the larger scale. There are, in fact, structures right in the human brain that look like this; a central neuron with neural pathways spinning off of it and traveling in different directions. This pattern also represents water in a few different ways: water running down a drain, water spinning into a whirlpool, and even water in a bath after it's been brushed by a hand. It could also be an idea. As we all know, ideas have a core as their center and then a bunch of other smaller ideas that spin off of it. What's happening in this picture is everything that has ever happened. Or, perhaps it's just a bunch of nothing with a central core. ",10/29/2015,10/29/2015,1205,73.279558

A few things popped into my mind when thinking this. The open window creating natural lighting, the monitor in the background sets the mood that it might be a conference room, although some conference rooms do have more of a closed environment. However in this case, the  open room says otherwise. The men in the background seemed to be relaxed before everything starts. It is very much possible that they are discussing life outside of work. The vibe they are giving are of some sort of relaxation. Their facial expression don't seemed to be too stressed. The woman with the clipboard seems to be the one who is possible running the meeting, or at least assisting. Many people who run meetings, or at least assisting, would use a clipboard to keep a list of tasks to go over. It seems like the woman in black has just arrived to the scene, and is asking about what to expect. In hindsight, she may also seem to be stressing out about work as the woman in the pink dress seems to be listening with intent. ","In this picture, it seems as if there is a team working on a mural. The person who's holding the paper seems to be the head of this project. He or she seems to be the person who is seeing the overall picture while directing. Of course he/she is also cooperating as a group. The people in the back are more than likely people who have collaborated with her before. The comfortable environment, the attire just screams a comfortable environment. The mural itself seems to be at a school of some sort.

The conversation furthest from the viewer is taking place between two caucasian males wearing business casual attire.  Both males have their arms crossed, indicative of either a defensive conversation or debate, or possibly anxiety about an issue outside of their immediate control.  The male on the left appears roughly 25 to 30 years old, has dark brown hair and a very light pink button down shirt, as well as a brown belt and khaki pants.  His conversation partner, another male, has a slightly lighter shade of hair and appears to be a bit younger, possibly early twenties in age.  He is wearing a light blue button down shirt, a thin brown leather belt and khaki dress pants.  Moving forwards we look at the closer set of conversationalists; a pair of women.  The woman on the left is caucasian with dark brown hair and is wearing a black dress.  She is reaching behind her neck with her right hand, possibly to scratch it, and is wearing a bright orange bracelet on her wrist. She appears to be leaning against the door, holding it open as she exits the room.  In her left hand, she is holding a slip of paper out towards her conversation companion, although it appears that she is not giving the paper to them as much as holding it while she talks and moves her hands while talking.  Her conversation partner is an african american woman with dark hair and a plum or mauve colored dress.  Additionally, she is wearing the same orange band on her right arm.  The orange band may be an entrance ticket to a conference.  The woman is holding a clipboard with her left arm, close to her body, and her left wrist has a blue plastic sports watch with a silver face and digital reading.  She is also wearing rings on both hands as she listens to her companion speak.","In this image we see a set of three juveniles working on a mural, while a fourth individual stands in the foreground watching them while holding a reference piece.  The mural itself appears to be an abstract representation of a galexy with the following attributes.  The background is a deep shade of blue or purple with the outermost layer of galexy being composed of a slightly lighter shade of purple.  The pattern of the paint is not streaking like stars or speckled, but it is more similar to that of a paint bucket being thrown against a wall while still achieving a specific pattern.  The next layer is a cerulean blue, although not all of the level is complete.  There are areas of an outline for where the juveniles will need to add paint but havne't gotten to on the upper left portion of the mural.  Interspersed throughout the blue is a salmon hue of pink that is ribboned in nature.  It is thin sections that are drawn out througout the blue layer.  The third layer is a marigold orange color and is achieving closer to an actual circular shape.  The next level is a lighter purple than the outer layer and is a circle with a few areas streaking out into the orange area.  The final area of the mural is an offwhite semi-circular shape.  The people working on the mural are not all able to be seen easily.  There is one person behind the reference image in the foreground that we can only see a white t-shirt of.  To the right of that person is another person who can barely be seen.  They appear to be caucasian and wearing a white t-shirt and dark colored shorts.

The Caucasian lady is running her fingers through her long dark hair as she looks to be explaining something to the African-American lady.

Surrounding the purple is a circle of yellow, with  random splashes of darker purple, light blue (almost teal, in a sense) and salmon in outward spirals surrounding the center of the painting.

One of the people working on it is standing up and painting the center of the painting. She is using a paint brush and painting the color in the middle of the painting. THe color that she is applying is white. She is wearing gloves and it is assumed that she is doing so because she doesn't want any paint to get on her hands.

The environment looks like an office, or business setting judging from the interior of the room beyond the doorway. In the foreground closest to the doorway opening are the two women and they are engaged in a conversation. On the left is a woman dressed in a black dress, with a orange band around her right wrist, she is faced away from the camera and her face is not visible. This woman is touching her hair. Her dress and demeanor are conservative and professional. The other woman whom the first woman is facing, faces the camera. The second woman is wearing a purple conservative and professional looking dress and she is hold a clip board in her left arm, which has a wristwatch on it. She is making a gesture with her fingers, as if she is counting on her fingers, and she is looking intently at the first woman.

He is wearing conservative attire, a dress shirt and khaki colored slacks. He is looking intently at the man on the right. The man on the right seems to be talking to the man on the left. He is also wearing business clothes, khaki colored slacks and a blue shirt. Beyond the two men is a large computer monitor or tv screen attached to the far wall. The image on the tv is indistinct, but consists of a lot of blue color shades and some red. I just noticed a small detail about the woman in the black dress, she is holding a small piece of paper out toward the woman in purple in her left hand. ","In this photo it appears that the cameraman is standing slightly to the left and directly behind a person who is holding a red plastic cup filled with blue paint and a abstract picture of a cosmos that is rendered in yellows, purples, and blues. This person has long hair past their shoulders. The person's hair is a light brownish red color, and falls down on their shoulder, the only shoulder visible, the left. This person appears to be wearing a black top. All that is really visible of this person in the foreground of the photo is their left hand holding the cup and picture and their left shoulder andthe left side of their head. In the background of the photo which dominates the majority of the photo in size, there is a concrete block wall that is painted black, on which two other persons seem to be painting the same image of a cosmos in yellows, blues, and purples. They are filling in an outline of the picture, in the various colors and this reminds me of one of the old paint-by-number images we used to paint in childhood. One person on the right of the background is standing up and painting at the center of the image with a gloved hand and probably with a sponge or brush, but it is not clear what kind of tool the person is painting with. In the persons other hand is a red plastic cup that probably contains a mauve colored paint as that is the color where her hand lies. Below her and to the left I see the back of another person who is dressed as the other painter in black shorts and a white tee shirt.

Beyond them we can glimpse a computer screen or two.  The men's body language (relaxed posture, arms folded loosely, relaxed faces) indicates that they are having a casual conversation, but the women appear to be having a more serious discussion.  The face of the woman on the right is clearly visible; she looks severe, perhaps mildly unhappy.  She is carrying a clipboard, giving her an air of authority.  The woman on the left has her back to the photographer, but the way she is leaning back from the other woman, almost as if backing through the doorway, and running her hand over her hair, indicates she is in some distress.  The woman on the right is black and wearing a purple dress.  The woman on the left is white and wearing a black shirt and black slacks.

The picture is taken so we see little of the woman - just a part of the back of her head and shoulder.  In front of her, she holds a picture that appears to be the same picture now being painted on the wall, and the proximity of the picture in her hand to the wall mural indicates that she is comparing the two.  Because of the way she is holding up the picture, we can only see one of the three painters clearly; the other two are largely blocked from the camera lens.  In the same hand that she holds the picture, the woman holds a red plastic cup that appears to contain light-blue paint of the same color being used in parts of the mural.  This suggests that she is one of the artists involved in the work.  The artists appear to have sketched the outlines of the painting (which is rather abstract, purple, yellow, pink, and multiple shades of blue color swirling around a white center, in a shape reminiscent of a galaxy) on the wall, and are now filling in the spaces with the correct colors, using the picture as a guide.

She is also using the woman in the purple's fill in responses to determine if her absence may be totally the blame if the client decides not to use her company's business or if they decide not the offer that was extended.

Both men have short, modern hair cuts. The man in the blue shirt looks concerned while the man in the white shirt looks more calm. The fact that both men have their arms folded gives off a tone of an unpleasant conversation. This conversation has both men guarded. 

The remaining two individuals in the photo are women. The first woman, who is the most visible in the photo, is an African American woman wearing a magenta pink work-appropriate dress. The dress is sleeveless and has a modest high neckline. She has a sporty blue watch on her left wrist, and an orange band on her right wrist. She is holding a clipboard close to her body, and appears to be counting with her fingers. The other woman is facing her back towards the camera as she speaks to the woman in magenta. She also has an orange band on her right wrist, and is holding a small note paper in her left hand. Her right hand is combing through her hair. This woman is white skinned, and is wearing a modest black dress. ","The photo shows two artists painting. One artist is kneeling on the floor, and is partially blocked by a piece of paper. This individual is wearing black athletic shorts and a white t-shirt. The other artist is a white female in her 20's or 30's. She has blonde hair in a pony tail and is wearing a white cap backwards. She is wearing sneakers, and is painting with a lavendar color on a brick wall filled with one big painted image. The artist has blue paint on her right hand, which is the same hand she is holding the paintbrush with. The artwork consists of the brick wall background painted a dark navy blue color, with a swirl pattern painted upon it.

The black woman is slightly more in frame, she's close to the middle of the photo and resides close to the middle of the doorway, she is wearing a purple dress and has straightened shoulder length hair. She has bags under her eyes, pencilled eyebrows, and otherwise average facial features for a black woman. She is holding a clipboard in her left arm, cradling it between her breast and left forear. Her right hand is forming a fist and interacting with her left hand, on her right forearm she has a band similar to the one on the white woman however this one has a visible wite strip, indicating that this might be some sort of medical facility. The black woman also has a blue watch in her left handm and she is using her fist and left fingers to count something.


The two people described are in the foreground of the photo, in the middle ground is are two white guys, one in a pink shirt and one in a blue shirt. Both are wearing chinos but the blue shirted one has a slightly darker grey pants color than his companion who is wearing a lighter grey. Both have their arms crossed and are faced at each other both with mouths slightly agape in conversaton. The blue shirt man is partial obstructed by the outer wall and we can only see a portion of his profile. The pink shirt man is between the woman in the middle ground and slightly obstructed, less so than the blue man. His back is to the camera however his head is turned completely to look at the blue shirt man who is sideways to the camera. In the background are white walls and what appear to be television displays airing blurry programming.","In the background of the photo which happens to be the focus, there is a grafitti painting of the milky way galaxy in an alternative color pattern. The distinctive spiral shape of the galaxy is visible but instead large regions and spirals are represented by non-uniform blobs of color. The art is being painted with a brush by a blonde woman with gloves ononto the wall. She is slightly bent over as to get a better angle and view of the drawing, she is holding in her irght hand the brush which is also the gloved hand and in her left she has a red solocup filled with water. She is wearing a tan cap and her face is away from the camera. She is wearing a white shirt, and black shorts and slightly worn sneakers. The ground is covered in a tarp and the remaning portion of the graffiti wall is blue, I would desccribe the blue as being comparible to the blue on a police officer uniform. There are outlets on the wall, bulky white boxes with black outlets. There are two other people completely obstructed in the photo who are also in the photo painting the wall and wearing similar clothing to the blonde woman. They are obstructed by a photo that is identical to the photo they are painting, the inspiration for the graffiti on the wall is most likely the photo that is obstructing the people. The photo is being held by a bruenette girl, face completely unseeable in the photo, she is holding a red solo cup filled with blue paint in her left hand and holding the obstructing photo between her fingers. She is looking at the wall.",10/20/2015,10/20/2015,1400,85.387734

They could be talking about an upcoming project or a current project being worked on.

Mulan has been at the company for only a few months and her job currently related to an upcoming Formula One race event. In addition to her regular responsibilities, Mulan likes to review data on key pieces of equipment. Mulan has a reputation in the industry for raising concerns about issues that other people either do not notice, or do not find problematic. While reviewing records this week, Mulan noticed what seemed to be failures in one of the component parts that connect to her equipment. While viewing a large set of schematics from recent track tests showing heat-related failures and graphs of temperature data, Mulan observed some burn patterns showing that, on a couple of the laps, a failure had apparently occurred that could have created an engine fire, though fortunately this did not happen. She became convinced that the design of athis part is fatally flawed and must be changed. However, this is something that could take months and cost beyond hundreds in thousands of dollars. In addition, rejecting the current design could delay scheduled track tests.       ","Joann had always wanted to paint exactly what was on her mind. But when she asked her friend to comment on her recent art rendition of the Milky Way at a nearby homeless shelter, she told her that more work on it would be necessary.

Symptoms of Joann's illness included: hair lice, paint intoxication, latex allergies, athlete's foot, breast-nipple rash, loss of appetite, shortness of breath with movement, sweating, and occassional vaginal yeast infectoin. By the end of the week, Joann finally decides to contact Doctor Victor Mott's office where the receptionist managed to find a rush sick appointment that afternoon. As a starving street artist, Joann does not get sick often but also does not have health coverage that permits seeing any of the doctors praticing in the local physician's clinic. So after checking in at the front desk, nurse Flanders acknowledged Joann's dilema and offered her a possible alternative. At this point, Joann wished this scenario was all but a nightmare which she can quickly wake up from. Nurse Flanders then asked Joann to follow her into a dimly-lit room.

The woman in the purple dress seems to be a little annoyed. Which leaves me to believe the meeting/presentation was about a sensitive, or emotion invoking topic. Maybe about a violation of company policy, or something similar.The people in the photo seem to be very engaged with each other in a mildly intense way. Which contributes to my theory that i believe the presentation got under some of the employees skin, which leads them to have discussion even after the meeting is over. ","This picture is of a Caucasian female wearing a white hat , white shirt, and black shorts. Painting art work on a concrete wall. There is no particular characteristic of the artwork.The artwork seems to abstract. The colors that the Caucasian woman is using to paint the wall are navy blue, sky blue, yellow purple, pink, and white. There are also two people on their knees beside the Caucasian female helping her paint the photo, but you cannot see their faces. Simply because there is someones head and arm in front of the photo camera blocking the view of the two people. The person in front of the camera is holding a red cup full of sky blue paint, and a small print copy of the artwork the Caucasian woman is painting on the wall. It is impossible to tell the the setting in which this picture is being taken, but from the look of the wall i would guess that it is a school, or a large building, because there is a large cloth on the floor to keep the paint from touching what i believe to be tile on the floor. Which lets me know it is not outdoors.",9/27/2015,9/27/2015,910,31.555325

I would also note that the woman in Purple is wearing the same orange wristband but it is more hidden from view. The two men in the back are not of any particular importance to the picture other than supporting the idea that it's an office environment. All of the subjects appear to be younger than 30, meaning this is could be a recruiting event or other sort of 'young professional' oriented gathering.

It appears that the teacher is the one standing back from the painting making sure it matches the plan for the mural. The wall is made of blocks that make it look like an institutional setting such as a school or hospital and these painters seem to be volunteers working with the woman with the plan.

The employee continues with the polite courtouses that she typically shows to everyone and responds accoordingly. After the pleasantries the supervisor gets down to the reall reason for the conversation. ""How do you feel about your recent job performance?"" This is never a good question to be asked. The employer feels trapped. If she answers honestly and says she has been slacking she is surely to look uncaring and passive to her supervisor. If she responds that she thinks shes been doing a fine job and her supervisor thinks otherwise (which is obvious per the stop in the hall) then she seems disillusioned.

The perspective is that the woman standing back maybe comparing her photo of the what is actually being painted on the wall.
